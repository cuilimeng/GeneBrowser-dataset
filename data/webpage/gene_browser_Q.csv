Summary
This gene encodes a preproprotein that is proteolytically processed to generate multiple protein products. The encoded products are members of the RFamide family of neuropeptides, characterized by their common protein C-terminus consisting of an arginine (R) and an amidated phenylalanine (F). These products include the neuropeptides 26RFa and the N-terminally extended form, 43RFa. Both of these neuropeptides bind to the pyroglutamylated RFamide peptide receptor (QRFPR) and may regulate blood pressure, reproduction and food intake in rodents.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes the enzyme dihydropteridine reductase, which catalyzes the NADH-mediated reduction of quinonoid dihydrobiopterin. This enzyme is an essential component of the pterin-dependent aromatic amino acid hydroxylating systems. Mutations in this gene resulting in QDPR deficiency include aberrant splicing, amino acid substitutions, insertions, or premature terminations. Dihydropteridine reductase deficiency presents as atypical phenylketonuria due to insufficient production of biopterin, a cofactor for phenylalanine hydroxylase.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that contains domains of thioredoxin and ERV1, members of two long-standing gene families. The gene expression is induced as fibroblasts begin to exit the proliferative cycle and enter quiescence, suggesting that this gene plays an important role in growth regulation. Two transcript variants encoding two different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Quinolinate acts as a most potent endogenous exitotoxin to neurons. Elevation of quinolinate levels in the brain has been linked to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts
