Summary
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the TDG/mug DNA glycosylase family. Thymine-DNA glycosylase (TDG) removes thymine moieties from G/T mismatches by hydrolyzing the carbon-nitrogen bond between the sugar-phosphate backbone of DNA and the mispaired thymine. With lower activity, this enzyme also removes thymine from C/T and T/T mispairings. TDG can also remove uracil and 5-bromouracil from mispairings with guanine. This enzyme plays a central role in cellular defense against genetic mutation caused by the spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine and cytosine. This gene may have a pseudogene in the p arm of chromosome 12.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a shape change and transformation sensitive actin-binding protein which belongs to the calponin family. It is ubiquitously expressed in vascular and visceral smooth muscle, and is an early marker of smooth muscle differentiation. The encoded protein is thought to be involved in calcium-independent smooth muscle contraction. It acts as a tumor suppressor, and the loss of its expression is an early event in cell transformation and the development of some tumors, coinciding with cellular plasticity. The encoded protein has a domain architecture consisting of an N-terminal calponin homology (CH) domain and a C-terminal calponin-like (CLIK) domain. Mice with a knockout of the orthologous gene are viable and fertile but their vascular smooth muscle cells exhibit alterations in the distribution of the actin filament and changes in cytoskeletal organization.","Variant counts

This protein is a member of the MDR/TAP subfamily. Members of the MDR/TAP subfamily are involved in multidrug resistance. This gene is located 7 kb telomeric to gene family member ABCB2. The protein encoded by this gene is involved in antigen presentation. This protein forms a heterodimer with ABCB2 in order to transport peptides from the cytoplasm to the endoplasmic reticulum. Mutations in this gene may be associated with ankylosing spondylitis, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and celiac disease. Alternative splicing of this gene produces products which differ in peptide selectivity and level of restoration of surface expression of MHC class I molecules.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is similar to oxidoreductases, which are enzymes involved in cellular responses to oxidative stresses and irradiation. This gene is induced by the tumor suppressor p53 and is thought to be involved in p53-mediated cell death. It contains a p53 consensus binding site in its promoter region and a downstream pentanucleotide microsatellite sequence. P53 has been shown to transcriptionally activate this gene by interacting with the downstream pentanucleotide microsatellite sequence. The microsatellite is polymorphic, with a varying number of pentanucleotide repeats directly correlated with the extent of transcriptional activation by p53. It has been suggested that the microsatellite polymorphism may be associated with differential susceptibility to cancer. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Transcription factors of the basic helix-loop-helix-zipper (bHLH-ZIP) family contain a basic domain, which is used for DNA binding, and HLH and ZIP domains, which are used for oligomerization. Transcription factor AP4 activates both viral and cellular genes by binding to the symmetrical DNA sequence CAGCTG (Mermod et al., 1988 [PubMed 2833704]; Hu et al., 1990 [PubMed 2123466]).","Variant counts

Summary
Microtubules of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton perform essential and diverse functions and are composed of a heterodimer of alpha and beta tubulins. The genes encoding these microtubule constituents belong to the tubulin superfamily, which is composed of six distinct families. Genes from the alpha, beta and gamma tubulin families are found in all eukaryotes. The alpha and beta tubulins represent the major components of microtubules, while gamma tubulin plays a critical role in the nucleation of microtubule assembly. There are multiple alpha and beta tubulin genes, which are highly conserved among species. This gene encodes alpha tubulin and is highly similar to the mouse and rat Tuba1 genes. Northern blot studies have shown that the gene expression is predominantly found in morphologically differentiated neurologic cells. This gene is one of three alpha-tubulin genes in a cluster on chromosome 12q. Mutations in this gene cause lissencephaly type 3 (LIS3) - a neurological condition characterized by microcephaly, intellectual disability, and early-onset epilepsy caused by defective neuronal migration. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
Tryptases comprise a family of trypsin-like serine proteases, the peptidase family S1. Tryptases are enzymatically active only as heparin-stabilized tetramers, and they are resistant to all known endogenous proteinase inhibitors. Several tryptase genes are clustered on chromosome 16p13.3. These genes are characterized by several distinct features. They have a highly conserved 3' UTR and contain tandem repeat sequences at the 5' flank and 3' UTR which are thought to play a role in regulation of the mRNA stability. These genes have an intron immediately upstream of the initiator Met codon, which separates the site of transcription initiation from protein coding sequence. This feature is characteristic of tryptases but is unusual in other genes. The alleles of this gene exhibit an unusual amount of sequence variation, such that the alleles were once thought to represent two separate genes, alpha and beta 1. Beta tryptases appear to be the main isoenzymes expressed in mast cells; whereas in basophils, alpha tryptases predominate. Tryptases have been implicated as mediators in the pathogenesis of asthma and other allergic and inflammatory disorders.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family, also called the 'RING-B-box-coiled-coil' (RBCC) subgroup of RING finger proteins. The TRIM motif includes three zinc-binding domains, a RING, a B-box type 1 and a B-box type 2, and a coiled-coil region. This protein localizes to cytoplasmic filaments. It is similar to a rat protein which is a specific partner for the tail domain of myosin V, a class of myosins which are involved in the targeted transport of organelles. The rat protein can also interact with alpha-actinin-4. Thus it is suggested that this human protein may play a role in myosin V-mediated cargo transport. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same isoform have been identified.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a DNA-binding protein which specifically recognizes conserved target sequences at the breakpoint junction of chromosomal translocations. Translin polypeptides form a multimeric structure that is responsible for its DNA-binding activity. Recombination-associated motifs and translin-binding sites are present at recombination hotspots and may serve as indicators of breakpoints in genes which are fused by translocations. These binding activities may play a crucial role in chromosomal translocation in lymphoid neoplasms. This protein encoded by this gene, when complexed with translin-associated protein X, also forms a Mg ion-dependent endoribonuclease that promotes RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) activation. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene is a nuclear hormone receptor for triiodothyronine. It is one of the several receptors for thyroid hormone, and has been shown to mediate the biological activities of thyroid hormone. Knockout studies in mice suggest that the different receptors, while having certain extent of redundancy, may mediate different functions of thyroid hormone. Mutations in this gene are known to be a cause of generalized thyroid hormone resistance (GTHR), a syndrome characterized by goiter and high levels of circulating thyroid hormone (T3-T4), with normal or slightly elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Several alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein have been observed for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is predicted to be a transmembrane protein. This gene is best known for localizing to the CpG island of the fragile site FRAXF. The 5' untranslated region of this gene contains a CGG trinucleotide repeat sequence that normally consists of 7-40 tandem CGG repeats but which can expand to greater than 300 repeats. Methylation of the CpG island leads to transcriptional silencing of this gene, but neither the silencing nor an expanded repeat region appear to manifest itself in a clear phenotypic manner. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. A pseudogene of this gene has been defined on the X chromosome.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the p53 family of transcription factors. The functional domains of p53 family proteins include an N-terminal transactivation domain, a central DNA-binding domain and an oligomerization domain. Alternative splicing of this gene and the use of alternative promoters results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms that vary in their functional properties. These isoforms function during skin development and maintenance, adult stem/progenitor cell regulation, heart development and premature aging. Some isoforms have been found to protect the germline by eliminating oocytes or testicular germ cells that have suffered DNA damage. Mutations in this gene are associated with ectodermal dysplasia, and cleft lip/palate syndrome 3 (EEC3); split-hand/foot malformation 4 (SHFM4); ankyloblepharon-ectodermal defects-cleft lip/palate; ADULT syndrome (acro-dermato-ungual-lacrimal-tooth); limb-mammary syndrome; Rap-Hodgkin syndrome (RHS); and orofacial cleft 8.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a highly conserved protein that localizes to the centrosome and/or ciliary basal body. Mutations in this gene disrupt Golgi morphology and trafficking and normal primary cilium formation and these mutations are congenitally manifested by severe undermineralization of the intra-uterine skeleton. A mutation in the mouse ortholog of this gene results in homeotic, posterior-to-anterior transformations of the axial skeleton which are similar to the phenotype of mouse homeobox C8 gene mutants. In mouse, this gene is thought to function downstream of homeobox C8 to transduce extracellular patterning information during axial skeleton development.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a glycoprotein with an approximate molecular weight of 76.5 kDa. It is thought to have been created as a result of an ancient gene duplication event that led to generation of homologous C and N-terminal domains each of which binds one ion of ferric iron. The function of this protein is to transport iron from the intestine, reticuloendothelial system, and liver parenchymal cells to all proliferating cells in the body. This protein may also have a physiologic role as granulocyte/pollen-binding protein (GPBP) involved in the removal of certain organic matter and allergens from serum.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene belongs to a small gene family whose members have an N-terminal VHS domain followed by a GAT domain; domains which typically participate in vesicular trafficking. The canonical protein encoded by this gene also has a C-terminal clathrin binding motif. This protein has been shown to interact with Tollip, clathrin and ubiquitin and is thought to play a role in endosomal sorting. This gene resides in the 3.7 Mb deletion of chromosome region 17p11.2 that is associated with Smith-Magenis syndrome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct proteins.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of a phylogenetically conserved family of genes that share a common DNA-binding domain, the T-box. T-box genes encode transcription factors involved in the regulation of developmental processes. This gene product shares 98% amino acid sequence identity with the mouse ortholog. DiGeorge syndrome (DGS)/velocardiofacial syndrome (VCFS), a common congenital disorder characterized by neural-crest-related developmental defects, has been associated with deletions of chromosome 22q11.2, where this gene has been mapped. Studies using mouse models of DiGeorge syndrome suggest a major role for this gene in the molecular etiology of DGS/VCFS. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that is required for DNA double-strand break repair, chromosome synapsis, and meiotic recombination in spermatocytes. Male mice with a knockout of the orthologous gene are viable but sterile. Loss-of-function mutations in the orthologous mouse gene cause early meiotic arrest in spermatocytes, before the mid-pachytene stage. Naturally occurring mutations in this gene are associated with nonobstructive azoospermia.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein with a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain containing several TPRs of about 34 aa each. These repeats are found in a variety of organisms including bacteria, fungi and plants, and are involved in a variety of functions including protein-protein interactions. This protein is embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane and is involved in the formation of the mitochondrial respiratory chain III. It has also been suggested that this protein plays a role in cytokinesis. Mutations in this gene cause mitochondrial complex III deficiency. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this intronless gene is an endothelial-specific type I membrane receptor that binds thrombin. This binding results in the activation of protein C, which degrades clotting factors Va and VIIIa and reduces the amount of thrombin generated. Mutations in this gene are a cause of thromboembolic disease, also known as inherited thrombophilia.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the taste receptor two family of class C G-protein coupled receptors. Receptors of this family have a short extracellular N-terminus, seven transmembrane helices, three extracellular loops and three intracellular loops, and an intracellular C-terminus. Members of this family are expressed in a subset of taste receptor cells, where they function in bitter taste reception, as well as in non-gustatory cells including those of the brain, reproductive organs, respiratory system, and gastrointestinal system. This gene maps to the taste receptor gene cluster on chromosome 12p13.","Variant counts

Summary
This nuclear gene encodes a mitochondrial tRNA-modifying enzyme. The encoded protein catalyzes the 2-thiolation of uridine on the wobble positions of tRNA(Lys), tRNA(Glu), and tRNA(Gln), resulting in the formation of 5-taurinomethyl-2-thiouridine moieties. Mutations in this gene may cause transient infantile liver failure. Polymorphisms in this gene may also influence the severity of deafness caused by mitochondrial 12S ribosomal RNA mutations. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protease that removes the N-terminal peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS2) from proteins produced in the cytosol, thereby facilitating their import into the peroxisome. The encoded protein is also capable of removing the C-terminal peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS1) from proteins in the peroxisomal matrix. The full-length protein undergoes self-cleavage to produce shorter, potentially inactive, peptides. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants for this gene.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a threonine synthase-like protein. A similar enzyme in mouse can catalyze the degradation of O-phospho-homoserine to a-ketobutyrate, phosphate, and ammonia. This protein also has phospho-lyase activity on both gamma and beta phosphorylated substrates. In mouse an alternatively spliced form of this protein has been shown to act as a cytokine and can induce the production of the inflammatory cytokine IL6 in osteoblasts. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the tectonin beta-propeller repeat-containing (TECPR) family, and contains both TECPR and tryptophan-aspartic acid repeat (WD repeat) domains. This gene has been implicated in autophagy, as reduced expression levels of this gene have been associated with impaired autophagy. Recessive mutations in this gene have been associated with a hereditary form of spastic paraparesis (HSP). HSP is characterized by progressive spasticity and paralysis of the legs. There is also some evidence linking mutations in this gene with birdshot chorioretinopathy (BSCR), which results in inflammation of the choroid and retina. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the tomoregulin family of transmembrane proteins. This protein has been shown to function as both an oncogene and a tumor suppressor depending on the cellular context and may regulate prostate cancer cell invasion. Multiple soluble forms of this protein have been identified that arise from both an alternative splice variant and ectodomain shedding. Additionally, this gene has been found to be hypermethylated in multiple cancer types. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family which plays a fundamental role in pathogen recognition and activation of innate immunity. TLRs are highly conserved from Drosophila to humans and share structural and functional similarities. They recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are expressed on infectious agents, and mediate the production of cytokines necessary for the development of effective immunity. The various TLRs exhibit different patterns of expression. This gene is most highly expressed in lymphoid tissues such as spleen, lymph node, thymus, and tonsil. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants which encode different protein isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. The encoded protein activates nuclear factor kappa-B and mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 (also called c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1), and induces cell apoptosis. Through its death domain, the encoded receptor interacts with tumor necrosis factor receptor type 1-associated death domain (TRADD) protein, which is known to mediate signal transduction of tumor necrosis factor receptors. Knockout studies in mice suggest that this gene plays a role in T-helper cell activation, and may be involved in inflammation and immune regulation.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the TNF-receptor superfamily. This receptor is expressed preferentially in the tissues enriched in lymphocytes, and it may play a role in regulating lymphocyte homeostasis. This receptor has been shown to stimulate NF-kappa B activity and regulate cell apoptosis. The signal transduction of this receptor is mediated by various death domain containing adaptor proteins. Knockout studies in mice suggested the role of this gene in the removal of self-reactive T cells in the thymus. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene encoding distinct isoforms have been reported, most of which are potentially secreted molecules. The alternative splicing of this gene in B and T cells encounters a programmed change upon T-cell activation, which predominantly produces full-length, membrane bound isoforms, and is thought to be involved in controlling lymphocyte proliferation induced by T-cell activation.","Variant counts

This gene is located in the RH gene locus, between the RHD and RHCE genes. The function of its protein product is unknown; however, its sequence has potential transmembrane domains suggesting that it may be an integral membrane protein. Its position between the RH genes suggests that polymorphisms in this gene may be tightly linked to RH haplotypes and may contribute to selective pressure for or against certain RH haplotypes.","Variant counts

Summary
DNA-binding transcriptional activator proteins increase the rate of transcription by interacting with the transcriptional machinery bound to the basal promoter in conjunction with adaptor proteins, possibly by acetylation and destabilization of nucleosomes. The protein encoded by this gene is a transcriptional activator adaptor and a component of the histone acetyl transferase (HAT) coactivator complex which plays a crucial role in chromatin modulation and cell cycle progression. Along with the other components of the complex, this protein links transcriptional activators bound to specific promoters, to histone acetylation and the transcriptional machinery. The protein is also involved in the stabilization and activation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein that plays a role in the cellular response to DNA damage. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants of this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a subunit of a large protein complex known as a vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase). The protein complex acts as a pump to move protons across the membrane. This movement of protons helps regulate the pH of cells and their surrounding environment. V-ATPase dependent organelle acidification is necessary for such intracellular processes as protein sorting, zymogen activation, and receptor-mediated endocytosis. V-ATPase is comprised of a cytosolic V1 domain and a transmembrane V0 domain. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Mutations in this gene are associated with infantile malignant osteopetrosis.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene is a death domain containing adaptor molecule that interacts with TNFRSF1A/TNFR1 and mediates programmed cell death signaling and NF-kappaB activation. This protein binds adaptor protein TRAF2, reduces the recruitment of inhibitor-of-apoptosis proteins (IAPs) by TRAF2, and thus suppresses TRAF2 mediated apoptosis. This protein can also interact with receptor TNFRSF6/FAS and adaptor protein FADD/MORT1, and is involved in the Fas-induced cell death pathway.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the tachykinin family of secreted neuropeptides. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate the mature peptide, which is primarily expressed in the central and peripheral nervous systems and functions as a neurotransmitter. This peptide is the ligand for the neurokinin-3 receptor. This protein is also expressed in the outer syncytiotrophoblast of the placenta and may be associated with pregnancy-induced hypertension and pre-eclampsia. Mutations in this gene are associated with normosmic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, at least one of which encodes an isoform that is proteolytically processed.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the tachykinin family of neurotransmitter-encoding genes. Tachykinin proteins are cleaved into small, secreted peptides that activate members of a family of receptor proteins. The products of this gene preferentially activate tachykinin receptor 1, and are thought to regulate peripheral endocrine and paracrine functions including blood pressure, the immune system, and endocrine gland secretion. The products of this gene lack a dibasic cleavage site found in other tachykinin proteins. Consequently, the nature of the cleavage products generated in vivo remains to be determined. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Tryptases comprise a family of trypsin-like serine proteases, the peptidase family S1. Tryptases are enzymatically active only as heparin-stabilized tetramers, and they are resistant to all known endogenous proteinase inhibitors. Several tryptase genes are clustered on chromosome 16p13.3. There is uncertainty regarding the number of genes in this cluster. Currently four functional genes - alpha I, beta I, beta II and gamma I - have been identified. And beta I has an allelic variant named alpha II, beta II has an allelic variant beta III, also gamma I has an allelic variant gamma II. Beta tryptases appear to be the main isoenzymes expressed in mast cells; whereas in basophils, alpha-tryptases predominant. This gene differs from other members of the tryptase gene family in that it has C-terminal hydrophobic domain, which may serve as a membrane anchor. Tryptases have been implicated as mediators in the pathogenesis of asthma and other allergic and inflammatory disorders.","Variant counts

Summary
Many DNA-binding transcriptional activator proteins enhance the initiation rate of RNA polymerase II-mediated gene transcription by interacting functionally with the general transcription machinery bound at the basal promoter. Adaptor proteins are usually required for this activation, possibly to acetylate and destabilize nucleosomes, thereby relieving chromatin constraints at the promoter. The protein encoded by this gene is a transcriptional activator adaptor and has been found to be part of the PCAF histone acetylase complex. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms of this gene have been described, but the full-length nature of some of these variants has not been determined.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a hemopoietic cytokine proposed to signal through a heterodimeric receptor complex composed of the thymic stromal lymphopoietin receptor and the IL-7R alpha chain. It mainly impacts myeloid cells and induces the release of T cell-attracting chemokines from monocytes and enhances the maturation of CD11c(+) dendritic cells. The protein promotes T helper type 2 (TH2) cell responses that are associated with immunity in various inflammatory diseases, including asthma, allergic inflammation and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The protein is therefore considered a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of such diseases. In addition, the shorter (predominant) isoform is an antimicrobial protein, displaying antibacterial and antifungal activity against B. cereus, E. coli, E. faecalis, S. mitis, S. epidermidis, and C. albicans. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a protein that functions in the DNA double-strand break repair pathway choice, promoting non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathways, and limiting homologous recombination. This protein plays multiple roles in the DNA damage response, including promoting checkpoint signaling following DNA damage, acting as a scaffold for recruitment of DNA damage response proteins to damaged chromatin, and promoting NHEJ pathways by limiting end resection following a double-strand break. These roles are also important during V(D)J recombination, class switch recombination and at unprotected telomeres. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the tenascin family of extracellular matrix glycoproteins. The tenascins have anti-adhesive effects, as opposed to fibronectin which is adhesive. This protein is thought to function in matrix maturation during wound healing, and its deficiency has been associated with the connective tissue disorder Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. This gene localizes to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class III region on chromosome 6. It is one of four genes in this cluster which have been duplicated. The duplicated copy of this gene is incomplete and is a pseudogene which is transcribed but does not encode a protein. The structure of this gene is unusual in that it overlaps the CREBL1 and CYP21A2 genes at its 5' and 3' ends, respectively. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a multifunctional proinflammatory cytokine that belongs to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily. This cytokine is mainly secreted by macrophages. It can bind to, and thus functions through its receptors TNFRSF1A/TNFR1 and TNFRSF1B/TNFBR. This cytokine is involved in the regulation of a wide spectrum of biological processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, lipid metabolism, and coagulation. This cytokine has been implicated in a variety of diseases, including autoimmune diseases, insulin resistance, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis ankylosing spondylitis, tuberculosis, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, and cancer. Mutations in this gene affect susceptibility to cerebral malaria, septic shock, and Alzheimer disease. Knockout studies in mice also suggested the neuroprotective function of this cytokine.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a thioredoxin-binding protein that is a member of the alpha arrestin protein family. Thioredoxin is a thiol-oxidoreductase that is a major regulator of cellular redox signaling which protects cells from oxidative stress. This protein inhibits the antioxidative function of thioredoxin resulting in the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and cellular stress. This protein also functions as a regulator of cellular metabolism and of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. This protein may also function as a tumor suppressor. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a beta-amyloid peptide-binding protein. It contains a structural module related to that of the seven transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptor superfamily and known to be important in heterotrimeric G protein activation. Beta-amyloid peptide has been established to be a causative factor in neuron death and the consequent diminution of cognitive abilities observed in Alzheimer's disease.

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene contains a structural module related to that of the seven transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. This protein has sequence and structural similarities to the beta-amyloid binding protein (BBP), but, unlike BBP, it does not regulate a response to beta-amyloid peptide. This protein may have regulatory roles in cell death or proliferation signal cascades. This gene has multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants which encode two different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes an endopeptidase that cleaves specific substrates following aspartate residues. The encoded protein undergoes posttranslational autoproteolytic processing to generate alpha and beta subunits, which reassemble into the active alpha2-beta2 heterotetramer. It is required to cleave MLL, a protein required for the maintenance of HOX gene expression, and TFIIA, a basal transcription factor. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described, but their biological validity has not been determined.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene is a transcription factor that binds the consensus sequence 5'-GCCNNNGGC-3'. The encoded protein functions as either a homodimer or as a heterodimer with similar family members. This protein activates the transcription of some genes while inhibiting the transcription of others. Defects in this gene are a cause of branchiooculofacial syndrome (BOFS). Three transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the AP-2 family of transcription factors. AP-2 proteins form homo- or hetero-dimers with other AP-2 family members and bind specific DNA sequences. They are thought to stimulate cell proliferation and suppress terminal differentiation of specific cell types during embryonic development. Specific AP-2 family members differ in their expression patterns and binding affinity for different promoters. This protein functions as both a transcriptional activator and repressor. Mutations in this gene result in autosomal dominant Char syndrome, suggesting that this gene functions in the differentiation of neural crest cell derivatives.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a member of the TATA box-binding protein family. TATA box-binding proteins play a critical role in transcription by RNA polymerase II as components of the transcription factor IID (TFIID) complex. The encoded protein does not bind to the TATA box and initiates transcription from TATA-less promoters. This gene plays a critical role in spermatogenesis, and single nucleotide polymorphisms in this gene may be associated with male infertility. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been observed for this gene, and a pseudogene of this gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 3.","Variant counts

Summary
The NF-kappa-B (NFKB) complex of proteins is inhibited by I-kappa-B (IKB) proteins, which inactivate NFKB by trapping it in the cytoplasm. Phosphorylation of serine residues on the IKB proteins by IKB kinases marks them for destruction via the ubiquitination pathway, thereby allowing activation and nuclear translocation of the NFKB complex. The protein encoded by this gene is similar to IKB kinases and can mediate NFKB activation in response to certain growth factors.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene is a component of the TFIID protein complex, a complex which binds to the TATA box in class II promoters and recruits RNA polymerase II and other factors. This particular subunit interacts with the largest TFIID subunit, as well as multiple transcription activators. The protein is required for transcription by promoters targeted by RNA polymerase II.","Variant counts

Summary
Initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II requires the activities of more than 70 polypeptides. The protein that coordinates these activities is transcription factor IID (TFIID), which binds to the core promoter to position the polymerase properly, serves as the scaffold for assembly of the remainder of the transcription complex, and acts as a channel for regulatory signals. TFIID is composed of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and a group of evolutionarily conserved proteins known as TBP-associated factors or TAFs. TAFs may participate in basal transcription, serve as coactivators, function in promoter recognition or modify general transcription factors (GTFs) to facilitate complex assembly and transcription initiation. This gene encodes one of the smaller subunits of TFIID that binds weakly to TBP but strongly to TAF1, the largest subunit of TFIID. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

This gene encodes an integral subunit of TFIID associated with all transcriptionally competent forms of that complex. This subunit interacts strongly with two TFIID subunits that show similarity to histones H3 and H4, and it may participate in forming a nucleosome-like core in the TFIID complex.

Summary
Initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II requires the activities of more than 70 polypeptides. The protein that coordinates these activities is transcription factor IID (TFIID), which binds to the core promoter to position the polymerase properly, serves as the scaffold for assembly of the remainder of the transcription complex, and acts as a channel for regulatory signals. TFIID is composed of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and a group of evolutionarily conserved proteins known as TBP-associated factors or TAFs. TAFs may participate in basal transcription, serve as coactivators, function in promoter recognition or modify general transcription factors (GTFs) to facilitate complex assembly and transcription initiation. This gene encodes one of the larger subunits of TFIID that is stably associated with the TFIID complex. It contributes to interactions at and downstream of the transcription initiation site, interactions that help determine transcription complex response to activators.","Variant counts

Summary
Initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II requires the activities of more than 70 polypeptides. The protein that coordinates these activities is the basal transcription factor TFIID, which binds to the core promoter to position the polymerase properly, serves as the scaffold for assembly of the remainder of the transcription complex, and acts as a channel for regulatory signals. TFIID is composed of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and a group of evolutionarily conserved proteins known as TBP-associated factors or TAFs. TAFs may participate in basal transcription, serve as coactivators, function in promoter recognition or modify general transcription factors (GTFs) to facilitate complex assembly and transcription initiation. This gene encodes the largest subunit of TFIID. This subunit binds to core promoter sequences encompassing the transcription start site. It also binds to activators and other transcriptional regulators, and these interactions affect the rate of transcription initiation. This subunit contains two independent protein kinase domains at the N- and C-terminals, but also possesses acetyltransferase activity and can act as a ubiquitin-activating/conjugating enzyme. Mutations in this gene result in Dystonia 3, torsion, X-linked, a dystonia-parkinsonism disorder. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants. This gene is part of a complex transcription unit (TAF1/DYT3), wherein some transcript variants share exons with TAF1 as well as additional downstream DYT3 exons.","Variant counts

In human, TAF9 and AK6 (GeneID: 102157402) are two distinct genes that share 5' exons. A similar but distinct gene (TAF9L) has been found on the X chromosome and a pseudogene has been identified on chromosome 19.

Summary
This gene, which is a member of the tetraspanin superfamily, is one of several tumor-suppressing subtransferable fragments located in the imprinted gene domain of chromosome 11p15.5, an important tumor-suppressor gene region. Alterations in this region have been associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Wilms tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, adrenocortical carcinoma, and lung, ovarian and breast cancers. This gene is located among several imprinted genes; however, this gene, as well as the tumor-suppressing subchromosomal transferable fragment 4, escapes imprinting. This gene may play a role in malignancies and diseases that involve this region, and it is also involved in hematopoietic cell function. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described, but their biological validity has not been determined.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is regulated as part of the p53 tumor suppressor pathway and encodes a protein with sequence similarity to the bisphosphate domain of the glycolytic enzyme that degrades fructose-2,6-bisphosphate. The protein functions by blocking glycolysis and directing the pathway into the pentose phosphate shunt. Expression of this protein also protects cells from DNA damaging reactive oxygen species and provides some protection from DNA damage-induced apoptosis. The 12p13.32 region that includes this gene is paralogous to the 11q13.3 region.","Variant counts

Activation of HIV-1 gene expression by the transactivator Tat is dependent on an RNA regulatory element (TAR) located downstream of the transcription initiation site. The protein encoded by this gene binds between the bulge and the loop of the HIV-1 TAR RNA regulatory element and activates HIV-1 gene expression in synergy with the viral Tat protein. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. This gene also has a pseudogene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that belongs to a family of GTPase activator proteins of Rab-like small GTPases. The encoded protein and its cognate GTPase, Rab1, bind the nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) to mediate viral replication. Depletion of this protein inhibits replication of the virus and HCV infection. Mutations in this gene are associated with Warburg micro syndrome 4. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
Cofactor E is one of four proteins (cofactors A, D, E, and C) involved in the pathway leading to correctly folded beta-tubulin from folding intermediates. Cofactors A and D are believed to play a role in capturing and stabilizing beta-tubulin intermediates in a quasi-native confirmation. Cofactor E binds to the cofactor D/beta-tubulin complex; interaction with cofactor C then causes the release of beta-tubulin polypeptides that are committed to the native state. Two transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a member of the tubby gene family of bipartite transcription factors. Members of this family have been identified in plants, vertebrates, and invertebrates, and they share a conserved N-terminal transcription activation region and a conserved C-terminal DNA and phosphatidylinositol-phosphate binding region. The encoded protein binds to phosphoinositides in the plasma membrane via its C-terminal region and probably functions as a membrane-bound transcription regulator that translocates to the nucleus in response to phosphoinositide hydrolysis, for instance, induced by G-protein-coupled-receptor signaling. It plays an important role in neuronal development and function. Two transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been identified for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein component of the spliceosome that promotes the release of the lariat-intron during late-stage splicing through the recruitment of a pre-mRNA splicing factor called DEAH-box helicase 15. The encoded protein contains a G-patch domain, a hallmark of RNA-processing proteins, that binds DEAH-box helicase 15. This protein contains an atypical nuclear localization sequence as well as a nuclear speckle-targeting sequence, enabling it to localize to distinct speckled regions within the cell nucleus. Polymorphisms in this gene are associated with dental caries suggesting a role in amelogenesis. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the U5 small ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP), and is involved in pre-mRNA splicing. This protein contains a thioredoxin-like fold and it is expected to interact with multiple proteins. Protein-protein interactions have been observed with the polyglutamine tract-binding protein 1 (PQBP1). Mutations in both the coding region and promoter region of this gene have been associated with Burn-McKeown syndrome, which is a rare disorder characterized by craniofacial dysmorphisms, cardiac defects, hearing loss, and bilateral choanal atresia. A pseudogene of this gene is found on chromosome 2. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the TIMP gene family. The proteins encoded by this gene family are natural inhibitors of the matrix metalloproteinases, a group of peptidases involved in degradation of the extracellular matrix. In addition to an inhibitory role against metalloproteinases, the encoded protein has a unique role among TIMP family members in its ability to directly suppress the proliferation of endothelial cells. As a result, the encoded protein may be critical to the maintenance of tissue homeostasis by suppressing the proliferation of quiescent tissues in response to angiogenic factors, and by inhibiting protease activity in tissues undergoing remodelling of the extracellular matrix.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene belongs to the TIMP gene family. The proteins encoded by this gene family are natural inhibitors of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a group of peptidases involved in degradation of the extracellular matrix. In addition to its inhibitory role against most of the known MMPs, the encoded protein is able to promote cell proliferation in a wide range of cell types, and may also have an anti-apoptotic function. Transcription of this gene is highly inducible in response to many cytokines and hormones. In addition, the expression from some but not all inactive X chromosomes suggests that this gene inactivation is polymorphic in human females. This gene is located within intron 6 of the synapsin I gene and is transcribed in the opposite direction.","Variant counts

Summary
This protein encoded by this gene catalyzes the transfer of a sulfur ion from 3-mercaptopyruvate to cyanide or other thiol compounds. It may be involved in cysteine degradation and cyanide detoxification. There is confusion in literature between this protein (mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase, MPST), which appears to be cytoplasmic, and thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (rhodanese, TST, GeneID:7263), which is a mitochondrial protein. Deficiency in MPST activity has been implicated in a rare inheritable disorder known as mercaptolactate-cysteine disulfiduria (MCDU). Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding same or different isoforms have been identified for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The TRAF (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor) family of proteins associate with and transduce signals from members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. The protein encoded by this gene is found in the cytoplasm and can bind to TRAF1, TRAF2, or TRAF3, thereby inhibiting TRAF function by sequestering the TRAFs in a latent state in the cytoplasm. For example, the protein encoded by this gene can block TRAF2 binding to LMP1, the Epstein-Barr virus transforming protein, and inhibit LMP1-mediated NF-kappa-B activation. Three alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Tryptases comprise a family of trypsin-like serine proteases, the peptidase family S1. Tryptases are enzymatically active only as heparin-stabilized tetramers, and they are resistant to all known endogenous proteinase inhibitors. Several tryptase genes are clustered on chromosome 16p13.3. These genes are characterized by several distinct features. They have a highly conserved 3' UTR and contain tandem repeat sequences at the 5' flank and 3' UTR which are thought to play a role in regulation of the mRNA stability. These genes have an intron immediately upstream of the initiator Met codon, which separates the site of transcription initiation from protein coding sequence. This feature is characteristic of tryptases but is unusual in other genes. The alleles of this gene exhibit an unusual amount of sequence variation, such that the alleles were once thought to represent two separate genes, beta II and beta III. Beta tryptases appear to be the main isoenzymes expressed in mast cells, whereas in basophils, alpha-tryptases predominate. Tryptases have been implicated as mediators in the pathogenesis of asthma and other allergic and inflammatory disorders.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the TNF-receptor superfamily. This receptor contains an extracellular TRAIL-binding domain and a transmembrane domain, but no cytoplasmic death domain. This receptor is not capable of inducing apoptosis, and is thought to function as an antagonistic receptor that protects cells from TRAIL-induced apoptosis. This gene was found to be a p53-regulated DNA damage-inducible gene. The expression of this gene was detected in many normal tissues but not in most cancer cell lines, which may explain the specific sensitivity of cancer cells to the apoptosis-inducing activity of TRAIL.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the TNF-receptor superfamily, and contains an intracellular death domain. This receptor can be activated by tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TNFSF10/TRAIL/APO-2L), and transduces an apoptosis signal. Studies with FADD-deficient mice suggested that FADD, a death domain containing adaptor protein, is required for the apoptosis mediated by this protein. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms and one non-coding transcript have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

This gene product is a serine/threonine protein kinase that contains an N-terminal protein kinase domain that is structurally similar to the kinase domains of testis-specific protein kinase-1 and the LIM motif-containing protein kinases (LIMKs). Its overall structure is most related to the former, indicating that it belongs to the TESK subgroup of the LIMK/TESK family of protein kinases. This gene is predominantly expressed in testis and prostate. The developmental expression pattern of the rat gene in testis suggests an important role for this gene in meitoic stages and/or early stages of spermiogenesis. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) protein family, which is a diverse group of proteins with structural features typical of ion channels. This protein plays an important role in taste transduction, and has characteristics of a calcium-activated, non-selective cation channel that carries Na+, K+, and Cs+ ions equally well, but not Ca(2+) ions. It is activated by lower concentrations of intracellular Ca(2+), and inhibited by higher concentrations. It is also a highly temperature-sensitive, heat activated channel showing a steep increase of inward currents at temperatures between 15 and 35 degrees Celsius. This gene is located within the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome critical region-1 on chromosome 11p15.5, and has been shown to be imprinted, with exclusive expression from the paternal allele.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes an adaptor protein containing a Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) homology domain, which is an intracellular signaling domain that mediates protein-protein interactions between the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and signal-transduction components. This protein is involved in native immunity against invading pathogens. It specifically interacts with toll-like receptor 3, but not with other TLRs, and this association mediates dsRNA induction of interferon-beta through activation of nuclear factor kappa-B, during an antiviral immune response. Mutations in this gene are associated with encephalopathy, acute, infection-induced.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene is a cytosolic enzyme that catalyzes the addition of a gamma-phosphate group to thymidine. This creates dTMP and is the first step in the biosynthesis of dTTP, which is one component required for DNA replication. The encoded protein, whose levels fluctuate depending on the cell cycle stage, can act as a low activity dimer or a high activity tetramer. High levels of this protein have been used as a biomarker for diagnosing and categorizing many types of cancers.","Variant counts

Protein kinase B (PKB) is a major downstream target of receptor tyrosine kinases that signal via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Upon cell stimulation, PKB is translocated to the plasma membrane, where it is phosphorylated in the C-terminal regulatory domain. The protein encoded by this gene negatively regulates PKB activity by inhibiting phosphorylation. Transcription of this gene is commonly downregulated in glioblastomas.","Variant counts

Summary
Constitutive activation of the Ras pathway triggers an irreversible proliferation arrest reminiscent of replicative senescence. Transcription of this gene is upregulated in response to activation of the Ras pathway, but not under other conditions that induce senescence. The encoded protein is similar to a rat cell surface receptor proposed to function in a neuronal survival pathway. An allelic polymorphism in this gene results in both functional and non-functional (frameshifted) alleles; the reference genome represents the functional allele.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes an enzyme that converts the pancreatic proenzyme trypsinogen to trypsin, which activates other proenzymes including chymotrypsinogen and procarboxypeptidases. The precursor protein is cleaved into two chains that form a heterodimer linked by a disulfide bond. This protein is a member of the trypsin family of peptidases. Mutations in this gene cause enterokinase deficiency, a malabsorption disorder characterized by diarrhea and failure to thrive.","Variant counts

Summary
Transglutaminases are enzymes that catalyze the crosslinking of proteins by epsilon-gamma glutamyl lysine isopeptide bonds. While the primary structure of transglutaminases is not conserved, they all have the same amino acid sequence at their active sites and their activity is calcium-dependent. The protein encoded by this gene acts as a monomer, is induced by retinoic acid, and appears to be involved in apoptosis. Finally, the encoded protein is the autoantigen implicated in celiac disease. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes. The cytochrome P450 proteins are monooxygenases which catalyze many reactions involved in drug metabolism and synthesis of cholesterol, steroids and other lipids. However, this protein is considered a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily on the basis of sequence similarity rather than functional similarity. This endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein catalyzes the conversion of prostglandin H2 to thromboxane A2, a potent vasoconstrictor and inducer of platelet aggregation. The enzyme plays a role in several pathophysiological processes including hemostasis, cardiovascular disease, and stroke. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that is related to chondromodulin-I, which is a cartilage-specific glycoprotein that functions to stimulate chondrocyte growth and to inhibit tube formation of endothelial cells. This protein is also an angiogenesis inhibitor. Genetic variation in this gene is associated with a risk for type 2 diabetes, central obesity and serum levels of systemic immune mediators in a body size-dependent manner. This gene is also a candidate gene for age-related macular degeneration, though a direct link has yet to be demonstrated.","Variant counts

Summary
Sarcomere assembly is regulated by the muscle protein titin. Titin is a giant elastic protein with kinase activity that extends half the length of a sarcomere. It serves as a scaffold to which myofibrils and other muscle related proteins are attached. This gene encodes a protein found in striated and cardiac muscle that binds to the titin Z1-Z2 domains and is a substrate of titin kinase, interactions thought to be critical to sarcomere assembly. Mutations in this gene are associated with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2G.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene has sequence similarity with members of the WD40 repeat-containing protein family. The WD40 group is a large family of proteins, which appear to have a regulatory function. It is believed that the WD40 repeats mediate protein-protein interactions and members of the family are involved in signal transduction, RNA processing, gene regulation, vesicular trafficking, cytoskeletal assembly and may play a role in the control of cytotypic differentiation. This gene has multiple polyadenylation sites. It might have multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants but the variants have not been fully described yet.","Variant counts

Summary
The product of this gene belongs to the WD-repeat TAF5 family of proteins. This gene encodes a protein that is a component of the PCAF histone acetylase complex. The PCAF histone acetylase complex, which is composed of more than 20 polypeptides some of which are TAFs, is required for myogenic transcription and differentiation. TAFs may participate in basal transcription, serve as coactivators, function in promoter recognition or modify general transcription factors to facilitate complex assembly and transcription initiation. The encoded protein is structurally similar to one of the histone-like TAFs, TAF5. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes transcription factor 4, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor. The encoded protein recognizes an Ephrussi-box ('E-box') binding site ('CANNTG') - a motif first identified in immunoglobulin enhancers. This gene is broadly expressed, and may play an important role in nervous system development. Defects in this gene are a cause of Pitt-Hopkins syndrome. In addition, an intronic CTG repeat normally numbering 10-37 repeat units can expand to >50 repeat units and cause Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants that encode different proteins have been described.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor family of high mobility group (HMG) box transcriptional activators. This gene is expressed predominantly in T-cells and plays a critical role in natural killer cell and innate lymphoid cell development. The encoded protein forms a complex with beta-catenin and activates transcription through a Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Mice with a knockout of this gene are viable and fertile, but display a block in T-lymphocyte differentiation. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Naturally-occurring isoforms lacking the N-terminal beta-catenin interaction domain may act as dominant negative regulators of Wnt signaling.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the E protein (class I) family of helix-loop-helix transcription factors. E proteins activate transcription by binding to regulatory E-box sequences on target genes as heterodimers or homodimers, and are inhibited by heterodimerization with inhibitor of DNA-binding (class IV) helix-loop-helix proteins. E proteins play a critical role in lymphopoiesis, and the encoded protein is required for B and T lymphocyte development. Deletion of this gene or diminished activity of the encoded protein may play a role in lymphoid malignancies. This gene is also involved in several chromosomal translocations that are associated with lymphoid malignancies including pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (t(1;19), with PBX1), childhood leukemia (t(19;19), with TFPT) and acute leukemia (t(12;19), with ZNF384). Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene, and a pseudogene of this gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 9.","Variant counts

This gene is a tumor suppressor gene that encodes the growth inhibitory protein hamartin. The encoded protein interacts with and stabilizes the GTPase activating protein tuberin. This hamartin-tuberin complex negatively regulates mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signalling which is a major regulator of anabolic cell growth. This protein also functions as a co-chaperone for Hsp90 that inhibits its ATPase activity. This protein functions as a facilitator of Hsp90-mediated folding of kinase and non-kinase clients, including Tsc2 and thereby preventing their ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Mutations in this gene have been associated with tuberous sclerosis.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the TNF receptor (TNFR) associated factor (TRAF) protein family. TRAF proteins associate with, and mediate the signal transduction from various receptors of the TNFR superfamily. This protein and TRAF2 form a heterodimeric complex, which is required for TNF-alpha-mediated activation of MAPK8/JNK and NF-kappaB. The protein complex formed by this protein and TRAF2 also interacts with inhibitor-of-apoptosis proteins (IAPs), and thus mediates the anti-apoptotic signals from TNF receptors. The expression of this protein can be induced by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). EBV infection membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is found to interact with this and other TRAF proteins; this interaction is thought to link LMP1-mediated B lymphocyte transformation to the signal transduction from TNFR family receptors. Three transcript variants encoding two different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

The protein complex formed by this protein and TRAF1 interacts with the inhibitor-of-apoptosis proteins (IAPs), and functions as a mediator of the anti-apoptotic signals from TNF receptors. The interaction of this protein with TRADD, a TNF receptor associated apoptotic signal transducer, ensures the recruitment of IAPs for the direct inhibition of caspase activation. BIRC2/c-IAP1, an apoptosis inhibitor possessing ubiquitin ligase activity, can unbiquitinate and induce the degradation of this protein, and thus potentiate TNF-induced apoptosis. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene, but the biological validity of only one transcript has been determined.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the TNF receptor associated factor (TRAF) protein family. TRAF proteins associate with, and mediate the signal transduction from, members of the TNF receptor (TNFR) superfamily. This protein participates in the signal transduction of CD40, a TNFR family member important for the activation of the immune response. This protein is found to be a critical component of the lymphotoxin-beta receptor (LTbetaR) signaling complex, which induces NF-kappaB activation and cell death initiated by LTbeta ligation. Epstein-Barr virus encoded latent infection membrane protein-1 (LMP1) can interact with this and several other members of the TRAF family, which may be essential for the oncogenic effects of LMP1. The protein also plays a role in the regulation of antiviral response. Mutations in this are associated with Encephalopathy, acute, infection-induced, herpes-specific 5.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the TNF receptor associated factor (TRAF) family. TRAF proteins are associated with, and mediate signal transduction from members of the TNF receptor superfamily. The encoded protein has been shown to interact with neurotrophin receptor, p75 (NTR/NTSR1), and negatively regulate NTR induced cell death and NF-kappa B activation. This protein has been found to bind to p47phox, a cytosolic regulatory factor included in a multi-protein complex known as NAD(P)H oxidase. This protein thus, is thought to be involved in the oxidative activation of MAPK8/JNK. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been observed but the full-length nature of only one has been determined.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the TNF receptor associated factor (TRAF) protein family. TRAF proteins are associated with, and mediate signal transduction from, members of the TNF receptor superfamily. This protein mediates signaling from members of the TNF receptor superfamily as well as the Toll/IL-1 family. Signals from receptors such as CD40, TNFSF11/RANCE and IL-1 have been shown to be mediated by this protein. This protein also interacts with various protein kinases including IRAK1/IRAK, SRC and PKCzeta, which provides a link between distinct signaling pathways. This protein functions as a signal transducer in the NF-kappaB pathway that activates IkappaB kinase (IKK) in response to proinflammatory cytokines. The interaction of this protein with UBE2N/UBC13, and UBE2V1/UEV1A, which are ubiquitin conjugating enzymes catalyzing the formation of polyubiquitin chains, has been found to be required for IKK activation by this protein. This protein also interacts with the transforming growth factor (TGF) beta receptor complex and is required for Smad-independent activation of the JNK and p38 kinases. This protein has an amino terminal RING domain which is followed by four zinc-finger motifs, a central coiled-coil region and a highly conserved carboxyl terminal domain, known as the TRAF-C domain. Two alternatively spliced transcript variants, encoding an identical protein, have been reported.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the AAA family of adenosine triphosphatases with similarity to Clp proteases and heat shock proteins. Alternative splicing at this locus results in the translation of multiple isoforms of the encoded protein, some of which contain salusin peptides in the C-terminal region. These peptides may play roles in hypotension, myocardial growth and the induction of mitogenesis, and may also be involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. The antimicrobial peptide salusin-beta has antibacterial activity.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a tumor suppressor protein containing transcriptional activation, DNA binding, and oligomerization domains. The encoded protein responds to diverse cellular stresses to regulate expression of target genes, thereby inducing cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence, DNA repair, or changes in metabolism. Mutations in this gene are associated with a variety of human cancers, including hereditary cancers such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Alternative splicing of this gene and the use of alternate promoters result in multiple transcript variants and isoforms. Additional isoforms have also been shown to result from the use of alternate translation initiation codons from identical transcript variants (PMIDs: 12032546, 20937277).","Variant counts

This gene encodes a cytoskeletal protein that is concentrated in areas of cell-substratum and cell-cell contacts. The encoded protein plays a significant role in the assembly of actin filaments and in spreading and migration of various cell types, including fibroblasts and osteoclasts. It codistributes with integrins in the cell surface membrane in order to assist in the attachment of adherent cells to extracellular matrices and of lymphocytes to other cells. The N-terminus of this protein contains elements for localization to cell-extracellular matrix junctions. The C-terminus contains binding sites for proteins such as beta-1-integrin, actin, and vinculin.","Variant counts

This nuclear enzyme is involved in processes such as chromosome condensation, chromatid separation, and the relief of torsional stress that occurs during DNA transcription and replication. It catalyzes the transient breaking and rejoining of two strands of duplex DNA which allows the strands to pass through one another, thus altering the topology of DNA. Two forms of this enzyme exist as likely products of a gene duplication event. The gene encoding this form, beta, is localized to chromosome 3 and the alpha form is localized to chromosome 17. The gene encoding this enzyme functions as the target for several anticancer agents and a variety of mutations in this gene have been associated with the development of drug resistance. Reduced activity of this enzyme may also play a role in ataxia-telangiectasia. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The tectorial membrane is an extracellular matrix of the inner ear that contacts the stereocilia bundles of specialized sensory hair cells. Sound induces movement of these hair cells relative to the tectorial membrane, deflects the stereocilia, and leads to fluctuations in hair-cell membrane potential, transducing sound into electrical signals. Alpha-tectorin is one of the major noncollagenous components of the tectorial membrane. Mutations in the TECTA gene have been shown to be responsible for autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing impairment and a recessive form of sensorineural pre-lingual non-syndromic deafness.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes one of three members of the Tribbles family. The Tribbles members share a Trb domain, which is homologous to protein serine-threonine kinases, but lacks the active site lysine and probably lacks a catalytic function. The Tribbles proteins interact and modulate the activity of signal transduction pathways in a number of physiological and pathological processes. This Tribbles member induces apoptosis of cells mainly of the hematopoietic origin. It has been identified as a protein up-regulated by inflammatory stimuli in myeloid (THP-1) cells, and also as an oncogene that inactivates the transcription factor C/EBPalpha (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha) and causes acute myelogenous leukemia. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a putative protein kinase that is induced by the transcription factor NF-kappaB. The encoded protein is a negative regulator of NF-kappaB and can also sensitize cells to TNF- and TRAIL-induced apoptosis. In addition, this protein can negatively regulate the cell survival serine-threonine kinase AKT1. Differential promoter usage and alternate splicing result in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a cytokine that belongs to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand family. This transmembrane cytokine is a bidirectional signal transducer that acts as a ligand for TNFRSF9/4-1BB, which is a costimulatory receptor molecule in T lymphocytes. This cytokine and its receptor are involved in the antigen presentation process and in the generation of cytotoxic T cells. The receptor TNFRSF9/4-1BB is absent from resting T lymphocytes but rapidly expressed upon antigenic stimulation. The ligand encoded by this gene, TNFSF9/4-1BBL, has been shown to reactivate anergic T lymphocytes in addition to promoting T lymphocyte proliferation. This cytokine has also been shown to be required for the optimal CD8 responses in CD8 T cells. This cytokine is expressed in carcinoma cell lines, and is thought to be involved in T cell-tumor cell interaction.","Variant counts

This cytokine is a ligand for TNFRSF8/CD30, which is a cell surface antigen and a marker for Hodgkin lymphoma and related hematologic malignancies. The engagement of this cytokine expressed on B cell surface plays an inhibitory role in modulating Ig class switch. This cytokine was shown to enhance cell proliferation of some lymphoma cell lines, while to induce cell death and reduce cell proliferation of other lymphoma cell lines. The pleiotropic biologic activities of this cytokine on different CD30+ lymphoma cell lines may play a pathophysiologic role in Hodgkin's and some non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the sedolisin family of serine proteases. The protease functions in the lysosome to cleave N-terminal tripeptides from substrates, and has weaker endopeptidase activity. It is synthesized as a catalytically-inactive enzyme which is activated and auto-proteolyzed upon acidification. Mutations in this gene result in late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, which is associated with the failure to degrade specific neuropeptides and a subunit of ATP synthase in the lysosome.","Variant counts

Summary
Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV) is an autosomal recessive dermatosis characterized by abnormal susceptibility to human papillomaviruses (HPVs) and a high rate of progression to squamous cell carcinoma on sun-exposed skin. EV is caused by mutations in either of two adjacent genes located on chromosome 17q25.3. Both of these genes encode integral membrane proteins that localize to the endoplasmic reticulum and are predicted to form transmembrane channels. This gene encodes a transmembrane channel-like protein with 10 transmembrane domains and 2 leucine zipper motifs.","Variant counts

Summary
Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV) is an autosomal recessive dermatosis characterized by abnormal susceptibility to human papillomaviruses (HPVs) and a high rate of progression to squamous cell carcinoma on sun-exposed skin. EV is caused by mutations in either of two adjacent genes located on chromosome 17q25.3. Both of these genes encode integral membrane proteins that localize to the endoplasmic reticulum and are predicted to form transmembrane channels. This gene encodes a transmembrane channel-like protein with 8 predicted transmembrane domains and 3 leucine zipper motifs.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a zinc-finger transcription factor that regulates smooth muscle cell differentiation in the developing urinary tract. Consistent with this role, mice in which this gene has been inactivated exhibit abnormal gene expression in urinary tract smooth muscle cell precursors and kidney defects including hydronephrosis. The encoded transcription factor comprises a gene silencing complex that inhibits caspase expression. Reduced expression of this gene and consequent caspase upregulation may be correlated with progression of Alzheimer's disease in human patients.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a small, highly conserved protein with a single PDZ domain. PDZ (PSD-95/Discs large/ZO-1 homologous) domains promote protein-protein interactions that affect cell signaling, adhesion, protein scaffolding, and receptor and ion transporter functions. The encoded protein interacts with a large number of target proteins that play roles in signaling pathways; for example, it interacts with Rho A and glutaminase L and also acts as a negative regulator of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. This protein was first identified as binding to the T-cell leukaemia virus (HTLV1) Tax oncoprotein. Overexpression of this gene has been implicated in altered cancer cell adhesion, migration and metastasis. The encoded protein also modulates the localization and density of inwardly rectifying potassium channel 2.3 (Kir2.3). To date, this protein has been shown to play a role in cell proliferation, development, stress response, and polarization. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the Tre-2/BUB2/CDC16 domain family. The protein encoded by this gene is a Rab-GTPase-activating protein, and contains two phopshotyrosine-binding domains (PTB1 and PTB2), a calmodulin-binding domain (CBD), a Rab-GTPase domain, and multiple AKT phosphomotifs. This protein is thought to play an important role in glucose homeostasis by regulating the insulin-dependent trafficking of the glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), important for removing glucose from the bloodstream into skeletal muscle and fat tissues. Reduced expression of this gene results in an increase in GLUT4 levels at the plasma membrane, suggesting that this protein is important in intracellular retention of GLUT4 under basal conditions. When exposed to insulin, this protein is phosphorylated, dissociates from GLUT4 vesicles, resulting in increased GLUT4 at the cell surface, and enhanced glucose transport. Phosphorylation of this protein by AKT is required for proper translocation of GLUT4 to the cell surface. Individuals homozygous for a mutation in this gene are at higher risk for type 2 diabetes and have higher levels of circulating glucose and insulin levels after glucose ingestion. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
This translocase is involved in the import and insertion of hydrophobic membrane proteins from the cytoplasm into the mitochondrial inner membrane. The gene is mutated in Mohr-Tranebjaerg syndrome/Deafness Dystonia Syndrome (MTS/DDS) and it is postulated that MTS/DDS is a mitochondrial disease caused by a defective mitochondrial protein import system. Defects in this gene also cause Jensen syndrome; an X-linked disease with opticoacoustic nerve atrophy and muscle weakness. This protein, along with TIMM13, forms a 70 kDa heterohexamer. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.","Variant counts

Exposure of some cell types to anti-PORIMIN (pro-oncosis receptor inducing membrane injury) antibody, crosslinks this protein on the cell surface and induces a type of cell death termed oncosis. Oncosis is distinct from apoptosis and is characterized by a loss of cell membrane integrity without DNA fragmentation. This gene product is proposed to function as a cell surface receptor that mediates cell death.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein with an N-terminal pleckstrin homology domain and a C-terminal coiled-coil region. The protein interacts with trio, which is involved with neural tissue development and controlling actin cytoskeleton organization, cell motility and cell growth. The protein also associates with F-actin and stabilizes F-actin structures. Mutations in this gene have been associated with a form of autosomal recessive nonsyndromic deafness. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants that would encode different isoforms have been found for this gene, however some transcripts may be subject to nonsense-mediated decay (NMD).","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein involved in regulating responses to cytokines by members of the Rel/NF-kappaB transcription factor family. These factors play a central role in innate immunity in response to pathogens, inflammatory signals and stress. This gene product interacts with TRAF proteins (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors) and either I-kappaB kinase or MAP kinase to activate either NF-kappaB or Jun kinase. Several alternative transcripts encoding different isoforms have been identified. Another transcript, which does not encode a protein and is transcribed in the opposite orientation, has been identified. Overexpression of this transcript has been shown to reduce expression of at least one of the protein encoding transcripts, suggesting it has a regulatory role in the expression of this gene.","Variant counts

Tropomyosins are dimers of coiled-coil proteins that polymerize end-to-end along the major groove in most actin filaments. They provide stability to the filaments and regulate access of other actin-binding proteins. In muscle cells, they regulate muscle contraction by controlling the binding of myosin heads to the actin filament. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Tropomyosins are dimers of coiled-coil proteins that provide stability to actin filaments and regulate access of other actin-binding proteins. Mutations in this gene result in autosomal dominant nemaline myopathy and other muscle disorders. This locus is involved in translocations with other loci, including anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK) and neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 1 (NTRK1), which result in the formation of fusion proteins that act as oncogenes. There are numerous pseudogenes for this gene on different chromosomes. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the tropomyosin family of highly conserved, widely distributed actin-binding proteins involved in the contractile system of striated and smooth muscles and the cytoskeleton of non-muscle cells. Tropomyosin is composed of two alpha-helical chains arranged as a coiled-coil. It is polymerized end to end along the two grooves of actin filaments and provides stability to the filaments. The encoded protein is one type of alpha helical chain that forms the predominant tropomyosin of striated muscle, where it also functions in association with the troponin complex to regulate the calcium-dependent interaction of actin and myosin during muscle contraction. In smooth muscle and non-muscle cells, alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding a range of isoforms have been described. Mutations in this gene are associated with type 3 familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.","Variant counts

This locus encodes the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta type III receptor. The encoded receptor is a membrane proteoglycan that often functions as a co-receptor with other TGF-beta receptor superfamily members. Ectodomain shedding produces soluble TGFBR3, which may inhibit TGFB signaling. Decreased expression of this receptor has been observed in various cancers. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a transmembrane protein that has a protein kinase domain, forms a heterodimeric complex with TGF-beta receptor type-1, and binds TGF-beta. This receptor/ligand complex phosphorylates proteins, which then enter the nucleus and regulate the transcription of genes related to cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest, wound healing, immunosuppression, and tumorigenesis. Mutations in this gene have been associated with Marfan Syndrome, Loeys-Deitz Aortic Aneurysm Syndrome, and the development of various types of tumors. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been characterized.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes the enzyme that metabolizes thiopurine drugs via S-adenosyl-L-methionine as the S-methyl donor and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine as a byproduct. Thiopurine drugs such as 6-mercaptopurine are used as chemotherapeutic agents. Genetic polymorphisms that affect this enzymatic activity are correlated with variations in sensitivity and toxicity to such drugs within individuals, causing thiopurine S-methyltransferase deficiency. Related pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes 3, 18 and X.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase-like (MAGUK) protein family which is characterized by members having multiple PDZ domains, a single SH3 domain, and a single guanylate kinase-like (GUK)-domain. In addition, members of the zonula occludens protein subfamily have an acidic domain, a basic arginine-rich region, and a proline-rich domain. The protein encoded by this gene plays a role in the linkage between the actin cytoskeleton and tight-junctions and also sequesters cyclin D1 at tight junctions during mitosis. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms. This gene has a partial pseudogene on chromosome 1.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family of proteins, and acts as a tight junction adaptor protein that also regulates adherens junctions. Tight junctions regulate the movement of ions and macromolecules between endothelial and epithelial cells. The multidomain structure of this scaffold protein, including a postsynaptic density 95/disc-large/zona occludens (PDZ) domain, a Src homology (SH3) domain, a guanylate kinase (GuK) domain and unique (U) motifs all help to co-ordinate binding of transmembrane proteins, cytosolic proteins, and F-actin, which are required for tight junction function. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a serine/threonine kinase that may be involved in the regulation of chromatin assembly. The encoded protein is only active when it is phosphorylated, and this phosphorylation is cell cycle-dependent, with the maximal activity of this protein coming during S phase. The catalytic activity of this protein is diminished by DNA damage and by blockage of DNA replication. Three transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a nuclear serine/threonine kinase that was first identified in Arabidopsis. The encoded protein is thought to function in the regulation of chromatin assembly in the S phase of the cell cycle by regulating the levels of a histone H3/H4 chaperone. This protein is associated with double-strand break repair of DNA damage caused by radiation. Pseudogenes of this gene are present on chromosomes 10 and 17. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
Tryptases comprise a family of trypsin-like serine proteases, the peptidase family S1. Tryptases are enzymatically active only as heparin-stabilized tetramers, and they are resistant to all known endogenous proteinase inhibitors. Several tryptase genes are clustered on chromosome 16p13.3. These genes are characterized by several distinct features. They have a highly conserved 3' UTR and contain tandem repeat sequences at the 5' flank and 3' UTR which are thought to play a role in regulation of the mRNA stability. Although this gene may be an exception, most of the tryptase genes have an intron immediately upstream of the initiator Met codon, which separates the site of transcription initiation from protein coding sequence. This feature is characteristic of tryptases but is unusual in other genes. Tryptases have been implicated as mediators in the pathogenesis of asthma and other allergic and inflammatory disorders. This gene was once considered to be a pseudogene, although it is now believed to be a functional gene that encodes a protein.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of a family of multipass membrane proteins that functions as calcium channels. The encoded protein contains N-terminal ankyrin repeats, which are required for channel assembly and regulation. Translation initiation for this protein occurs at a non-AUG start codon that is decoded as methionine. This gene is situated next to a closely related gene for transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 5 (TRPV5). This locus has experienced positive selection in non-African populations, resulting in several non-synonymous codon differences among individuals of different genetic backgrounds.","Variant counts

Summary
Capsaicin, the main pungent ingredient in hot chili peppers, elicits a sensation of burning pain by selectively activating sensory neurons that convey information about noxious stimuli to the central nervous system. The protein encoded by this gene is a receptor for capsaicin and is a non-selective cation channel that is structurally related to members of the TRP family of ion channels. This receptor is also activated by increases in temperature in the noxious range, suggesting that it functions as a transducer of painful thermal stimuli in vivo. Four transcript variants encoding the same protein, but with different 5' UTR sequence, have been described for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene product belongs to a family of nonselective cation channels that function in a variety of processes, including temperature sensation and vasoregulation. The thermosensitive members of this family are expressed in subsets of sensory neurons that terminate in the skin, and are activated at distinct physiological temperatures. This channel is activated at temperatures between 22 and 40 degrees C. This gene lies in close proximity to another family member gene on chromosome 17, and the two encoded proteins are thought to associate with each other to form heteromeric channels. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a secretory protein that contains a hyaluronan-binding domain, and thus is a member of the hyaluronan-binding protein family. The hyaluronan-binding domain is known to be involved in extracellular matrix stability and cell migration. This protein has been shown to form a stable complex with inter-alpha-inhibitor (I alpha I), and thus enhance the serine protease inhibitory activity of I alpha I, which is important in the protease network associated with inflammation. This gene can be induced by proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1. Enhanced levels of this protein are found in the synovial fluid of patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a secreted ligand of the TGF-beta (transforming growth factor-beta) superfamily of proteins. Ligands of this family bind various TGF-beta receptors leading to recruitment and activation of SMAD family transcription factors that regulate gene expression. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate a latency-associated peptide (LAP) and a mature peptide, and is found in either a latent form composed of a mature peptide homodimer, a LAP homodimer, and a latent TGF-beta binding protein, or in an active form consisting solely of the mature peptide homodimer. The mature peptide may also form heterodimers with other TGFB family members. This encoded protein regulates cell proliferation, differentiation and growth, and can modulate expression and activation of other growth factors including interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha. This gene is frequently upregulated in tumor cells, and mutations in this gene result in Camurati-Engelmann disease.","Variant counts

The mature peptide may also form heterodimers with other TGF-beta family members. Disruption of the TGF-beta/SMAD pathway has been implicated in a variety of human cancers. A chromosomal translocation that includes this gene is associated with Peters' anomaly, a congenital defect of the anterior chamber of the eye. Mutations in this gene may be associated with Loeys-Dietz syndrome. This gene encodes multiple isoforms that may undergo similar proteolytic processing.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand family. This protein is a ligand for TNFRSF17/BCMA, a member of the TNF receptor family. This protein and its receptor are both found to be important for B cell development. In vitro experiments suggested that this protein may be able to induce apoptosis through its interaction with other TNF receptor family proteins such as TNFRSF6/FAS and TNFRSF14/HVEM. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Some transcripts that skip the last exon of the upstream gene (TNFSF12) and continue into the second exon of this gene have been identified; such read-through transcripts are contained in GeneID 407977, TNFSF12-TNFSF13.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a cytokine that belongs to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand family. This protein is a ligand for the FN14/TWEAKR receptor. This cytokine has overlapping signaling functions with TNF, but displays a much wider tissue distribution. This cytokine, which exists in both membrane-bound and secreted forms, can induce apoptosis via multiple pathways of cell death in a cell type-specific manner. This cytokine is also found to promote proliferation and migration of endothelial cells, and thus acts as a regulator of angiogenesis. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Some transcripts skip the last exon of this gene and continue into the second exon of the neighboring TNFSF13 gene; such read-through transcripts are contained in GeneID 407977, TNFSF12-TNFSF13.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) cytokine family which is a ligand for osteoprotegerin and functions as a key factor for osteoclast differentiation and activation. This protein was shown to be a dentritic cell survival factor and is involved in the regulation of T cell-dependent immune response. T cell activation was reported to induce expression of this gene and lead to an increase of osteoclastogenesis and bone loss. This protein was shown to activate antiapoptotic kinase AKT/PKB through a signaling complex involving SRC kinase and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 6, which indicated this protein may have a role in the regulation of cell apoptosis. Targeted disruption of the related gene in mice led to severe osteopetrosis and a lack of osteoclasts. The deficient mice exhibited defects in early differentiation of T and B lymphocytes, and failed to form lobulo-alveolar mammary structures during pregnancy. Two alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a cytokine that belongs to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand family. This protein preferentially induces apoptosis in transformed and tumor cells, but does not appear to kill normal cells although it is expressed at a significant level in most normal tissues. This protein binds to several members of TNF receptor superfamily including TNFRSF10A/TRAILR1, TNFRSF10B/TRAILR2, TNFRSF10C/TRAILR3, TNFRSF10D/TRAILR4, and possibly also to TNFRSF11B/OPG. The activity of this protein may be modulated by binding to the decoy receptors TNFRSF10C/TRAILR3, TNFRSF10D/TRAILR4, and TNFRSF11B/OPG that cannot induce apoptosis. The binding of this protein to its receptors has been shown to trigger the activation of MAPK8/JNK, caspase 8, and caspase 3. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a cytokine that belongs to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand family. This protein is abundantly expressed in endothelial cells, but is not expressed in either B or T cells. The expression of this protein is inducible by TNF and IL-1 alpha. This cytokine is a ligand for receptor TNFRSF25 and decoy receptor TNFRSF21/DR6. It can activate NF-kappaB and MAP kinases, and acts as an autocrine factor to induce apoptosis in endothelial cells. This cytokine is also found to inhibit endothelial cell proliferation, and thus may function as an angiogenesis inhibitor. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Wybutosine is a hypermodified guanosine found in phenylalanine tRNA. Wybutosine functions to stabilize codon-anticodon interactions during ribosome decoding and therefore supports the maintenance of the reading frame. In yeast, the homolog of this gene is essential for the synthesis of wybutosine. The human genome contains two closely related genes that putatively function in wybutosine synthesis. The open reading frame of this locus is disrupted in some individuals. Thus, this locus appears to be an evolving pseudogene, but may still be functional in some members of the population.","Variant counts

Summary
Overexpression of the TCL1 gene in humans has been implicated in the development of mature T cell leukemia, in which chromosomal rearrangements bring the TCL1 gene in close proximity to the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR)-alpha (MIM 186880) or TCR-beta (MIM 186930) regulatory elements (summarized by Virgilio et al., 1998 [PubMed 9520462]). In normal T cells TCL1 is expressed in CD4-/CD8- cells, but not in cells at later stages of differentiation. TCL1 functions as a coactivator of the cell survival kinase AKT (MIM 164730) (Laine et al., 2000 [PubMed 10983986]).","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of a conserved family of genes that share a common DNA-binding domain, the T-box. T-box genes encode transcription factors involved in the regulation of numerous developmental processes. In mouse, the ortholog of this gene is expressed in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, amygdala and olfactory bulb and is thought to play an important role in neuronal migration and axonal projection. In mouse, the C-terminal region of this protein was found to be necessary and sufficient for association with the guanylate kinase domain of calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a large abundant protein of striated muscle. The product of this gene is divided into two regions, a N-terminal I-band and a C-terminal A-band. The I-band, which is the elastic part of the molecule, contains two regions of tandem immunoglobulin domains on either side of a PEVK region that is rich in proline, glutamate, valine and lysine. The A-band, which is thought to act as a protein-ruler, contains a mixture of immunoglobulin and fibronectin repeats, and possesses kinase activity. An N-terminal Z-disc region and a C-terminal M-line region bind to the Z-line and M-line of the sarcomere, respectively, so that a single titin molecule spans half the length of a sarcomere. Titin also contains binding sites for muscle associated proteins so it serves as an adhesion template for the assembly of contractile machinery in muscle cells. It has also been identified as a structural protein for chromosomes. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants. Considerable variability exists in the I-band, the M-line and the Z-disc regions of titin. Variability in the I-band region contributes to the differences in elasticity of different titin isoforms and, therefore, to the differences in elasticity of different muscle types. Mutations in this gene are associated with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 9, and autoantibodies to titin are produced in patients with the autoimmune disease scleroderma.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the PAR (proline and acidic amino acid-rich) subfamily of basic region/leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors. It is expressed in a broad range of cells and tissues in adult animals, however, during embryonic development, TEF expression appears to be restricted to the developing anterior pituitary gland, coincident with the appearance of thyroid-stimulating hormone, beta (TSHB). Indeed, TEF can bind to, and transactivate the TSHB promoter. It shows homology (in the functional domains) with other members of the PAR-bZIP subfamily of transcription factors, which include albumin D box-binding protein (DBP), human hepatic leukemia factor (HLF) and chicken vitellogenin gene-binding protein (VBP); VBP is considered the chicken homologue of TEF. Different members of the subfamily can readily form heterodimers, and share DNA-binding, and transcriptional regulatory properties. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Cancer-associated chromosomal changes often involve regions containing fragile sites. This gene maps to a commom fragile site on chromosome 7q31.2 designated FRA7G. This gene is similar to mouse Testin, a testosterone-responsive gene encoding a Sertoli cell secretory protein containing three LIM domains. LIM domains are double zinc-finger motifs that mediate protein-protein interactions between transcription factors, cytoskeletal proteins and signaling proteins. This protein is a negative regulator of cell growth and may act as a tumor suppressor. This scaffold protein may also play a role in cell adhesion, cell spreading and in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Multiple protein isoforms are encoded by transcript variants of this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the beta tubulin family. Beta tubulins are one of two core protein families (alpha and beta tubulins) that heterodimerize and assemble to form microtubules. Mutations in this gene cause hypomyelinating leukodystrophy-6 and autosomal dominant torsion dystonia-4. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. A pseudogene of this gene is found on chromosome X.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a RAC1-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). GEFs mediate the exchange of guanosine diphosphate (GDP) for guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The binding of GTP induces a conformational change in RAC1 that allows downstream effectors to bind and transduce a signal. This gene thus regulates RAC1 signaling pathways that affect cell shape, migration, adhesion, growth, survival, and polarity, as well as influencing actin cytoskeletal formation, endocytosis, and membrane trafficking. This gene thus plays an important role in cell invasion, metastasis, and carcinogenesis. In addition to RAC1, the encoded protein activates additional Rho-like GTPases such as CDC42, RAC2, RAC3 and RHOA. This gene encodes multiple protein isoforms that experience a diverse array of intramolecular, protein-protein, and phosphorylation interactions as well as phosphoinositide binding. Both the longer and shorter isoforms have C-terminal Dbl homology (DH) and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains while only the longer isoforms of this gene have the N-terminal myristoylation site and the downstream N-terminal PH domain, ras-binding domain (RBD), and PSD-95/DlgA/ZO-1 (PDZ) domain.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene forms a receptor-activated calcium channel in the cell membrane. The channel is activated by diacylglycerol and is thought to be under the control of a phosphatidylinositol second messenger system. Activation of this channel occurs independently of protein kinase C and is not triggered by low levels of intracellular calcium. Defects in this gene are a cause of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis 2 (FSGS2).","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of a phylogenetically conserved family of genes that share a common DNA-binding domain, the T-box. T-box genes encode transcription factors involved in the regulation of developmental processes. Mutations in this gene were found in patients with isolated deficiency of pituitary POMC-derived ACTH, suggesting an essential role for this gene in differentiation of the pituitary POMC lineage. ACTH deficiency is characterized by adrenal insufficiency symptoms such as weight loss, lack of appetite (anorexia), weakness, nausea, vomiting, and low blood pressure.","Variant counts

Summary
Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein polymerase that maintains telomere ends by addition of the telomere repeat TTAGGG. The enzyme consists of a protein component with reverse transcriptase activity, encoded by this gene, and an RNA component which serves as a template for the telomere repeat. Telomerase expression plays a role in cellular senescence, as it is normally repressed in postnatal somatic cells resulting in progressive shortening of telomeres. Deregulation of telomerase expression in somatic cells may be involved in oncogenesis. Studies in mouse suggest that telomerase also participates in chromosomal repair, since de novo synthesis of telomere repeats may occur at double-stranded breaks. Alternatively spliced variants encoding different isoforms of telomerase reverse transcriptase have been identified; the full-length sequence of some variants has not been determined. Alternative splicing at this locus is thought to be one mechanism of regulation of telomerase activity.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that is a subunit of troponin, which is a regulatory complex located on the thin filament of the sarcomere. This complex regulates striated muscle contraction in response to fluctuations in intracellular calcium concentration. This complex is composed of three subunits: troponin C, which binds calcium, troponin T, which binds tropomyosin, and troponin I, which is an inhibitory subunit. This protein is the slow skeletal troponin T subunit. Mutations in this gene cause nemaline myopathy type 5, also known as Amish nemaline myopathy, a neuromuscular disorder characterized by muscle weakness and rod-shaped, or nemaline, inclusions in skeletal muscle fibers which affects infants, resulting in death due to respiratory insufficiency, usually in the second year. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The binding of Ca(2+) to the trimeric troponin complex initiates the process of muscle contraction. Increased Ca(2+) concentrations produce a conformational change in the troponin complex that is transmitted to tropomyosin dimers situated along actin filaments. The altered conformation permits increased interaction between a myosin head and an actin filament which, ultimately, produces a muscle contraction. The troponin complex has protein subunits C, I, and T. Subunit C binds Ca(2+) and subunit I binds to actin and inhibits actin-myosin interaction. Subunit T binds the troponin complex to the tropomyosin complex and is also required for Ca(2+)-mediated activation of actomyosin ATPase activity. There are 3 different troponin T genes that encode tissue-specific isoforms of subunit T for fast skeletal-, slow skeletal-, and cardiac-muscle. This gene encodes fast skeletal troponin T protein; also known as troponin T type 3. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding additional distinct troponin T type 3 isoforms. A developmentally regulated switch between fetal/neonatal and adult troponin T type 3 isoforms occurs. Additional splice variants have been described but their biological validity has not been established. Mutations in this gene may cause distal arthrogryposis multiplex congenita type 2B (DA2B).","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a tyrosine kinase that binds Cdc42Hs in its GTP-bound form and inhibits both the intrinsic and GTPase-activating protein (GAP)-stimulated GTPase activity of Cdc42Hs. This binding is mediated by a unique sequence of 47 amino acids C-terminal to an SH3 domain. The protein may be involved in a regulatory mechanism that sustains the GTP-bound active form of Cdc42Hs and which is directly linked to a tyrosine phosphorylation signal transduction pathway. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants have been identified from this gene, but the full-length nature of only two transcript variants has been determined.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the tyrosine protein kinase family. Tyrosine protein kinases are important regulators of intracellular signal transduction pathways, mediating cellular proliferation, survival, and development. This gene is highly expressed in fetal tissues and at lower levels in few adult tissues, thus may function in signaling pathways utilized broadly during fetal development, and more selectively in adult tissues. It plays a negative regulatory role in the Ras-Raf1-MAPK pathway, and knockout mice have been shown to develop spontaneous tumors, suggesting a role as a tumor suppressor gene. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Thyroglobulin (Tg) is a glycoprotein homodimer produced predominantly by the thryroid gland. It acts as a substrate for the synthesis of thyroxine and triiodothyronine as well as the storage of the inactive forms of thyroid hormone and iodine. Thyroglobulin is secreted from the endoplasmic reticulum to its site of iodination, and subsequent thyroxine biosynthesis, in the follicular lumen. Mutations in this gene cause thyroid dyshormonogenesis, manifested as goiter, and are associated with moderate to severe congenital hypothyroidism. Polymorphisms in this gene are associated with susceptibility to autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITD) such as Graves disease and Hashimoto thryoiditis.","Variant counts

Summary
The innate immune system recognizes microbial pathogens through Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which identify pathogen-associated molecular patterns. Different TLRs recognize different pathogen-associated molecular patterns and all TLRs have a Toll-interleukin 1 receptor (TIR) domain, which is responsible for signal transduction. The protein encoded by this gene is a TIR adaptor protein involved in the TLR4 signaling pathway of the immune system. It activates NF-kappa-B, MAPK1, MAPK3 and JNK, which then results in cytokine secretion and the inflammatory response. Alternative splicing of this gene results in several transcript variants; however, not all variants have been fully described.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a fast-twitch skeletal muscle protein, a member of the troponin I gene family, and a component of the troponin complex including troponin T, troponin C and troponin I subunits. The troponin complex, along with tropomyosin, is responsible for the calcium-dependent regulation of striated muscle contraction. Mouse studies show that this component is also present in vascular smooth muscle and may play a role in regulation of smooth muscle function. In addition to muscle tissues, this protein is found in corneal epithelium, cartilage where it is an inhibitor of angiogenesis to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis, and mammary gland where it functions as a co-activator of estrogen receptor-related receptor alpha. This protein also suppresses tumor growth in human ovarian carcinoma. Mutations in this gene cause myopathy and distal arthrogryposis type 2B. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Troponin I (TnI), along with troponin T (TnT) and troponin C (TnC), is one of 3 subunits that form the troponin complex of the thin filaments of striated muscle. TnI is the inhibitory subunit; blocking actin-myosin interactions and thereby mediating striated muscle relaxation. The TnI subfamily contains three genes: TnI-skeletal-fast-twitch, TnI-skeletal-slow-twitch, and TnI-cardiac. This gene encodes the TnI-cardiac protein and is exclusively expressed in cardiac muscle tissues. Mutations in this gene cause familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy type 7 (CMH7) and familial restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM). Troponin I is useful in making a diagnosis of heart failure, and of ischemic heart disease. An elevated level of troponin is also now used as indicator of acute myocardial injury in patients hospitalized with moderate/severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Such elevation has also been associated with higher risk of mortality in cardiovascular disease patients hospitalized due to COVID-19.","Variant counts

The TnI-fast and TnI-slow genes are expressed in fast-twitch and slow-twitch skeletal muscle fibers, respectively, while the TnI-cardiac gene is expressed exclusively in cardiac muscle tissue. This gene encodes the Troponin-I-skeletal-slow-twitch protein. This gene is expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle during early development but is restricted to slow-twitch skeletal muscle fibers in adults. The encoded protein prevents muscle contraction by inhibiting calcium-mediated conformational changes in actin-myosin complexes.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to a group of apparently inactive homologs of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. The gene product contains a coiled-coil domain that interacts with stathmin, a cytosolic phosphoprotein implicated in tumorigenesis. The protein may play a role in cell growth and differentiation and act as a negative growth regulator. In vitro steady-state expression of this tumor susceptibility gene appears to be important for maintenance of genomic stability and cell cycle regulation. Mutations and alternative splicing in this gene occur in high frequency in breast cancer and suggest that defects occur during breast cancer tumorigenesis and/or progression.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a tripartite motif (TRIM) family member that contains two B box domains and a coiled-coiled region that are characteristic of the B box zinc finger protein family. While it lacks a RING domain found in other TRIM proteins, the encoded protein can homodimerize or heterodimerize with other TRIM proteins and has E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. This gene is also a tumor suppressor and is involved in secretory autophagy.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene belongs to the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. The encoded protein is postulated to play a regulatory role in suppressing FasL- and LIGHT-mediated cell death. It acts as a decoy receptor that competes with death receptors for ligand binding. Over-expression of this gene has been noted in gastrointestinal tract tumors. Read-through transcription into this gene from the neighboring upstream gene, which encodes regulator of telomere elongation helicase 1 (RTEL1), generates a non-coding transcript.","Variant counts

This gene belongs to the transport and Golgi organization family, whose members are predicted to play roles in secretory protein loading in the endoplasmic reticulum. Depletion of this gene in Drosophila S2 cells causes fusion of the Golgi with the ER. In mouse tissue culture cells, this protein co-localizes with a mitochondrially targeted mCherry protein and displays very low levels of co-localization with Golgi and peroxisomes. Allelic variants of this gene are associated with rhabdomyolysis, metabolic crises with encephalopathy, and cardiac arrhythmia.","Variant counts

Summary
This locus represents naturally occurring readthrough transcription between the neighboring TVP23C (trans-golgi network vesicle protein 23 homolog) and CDRT4 (CMT1A duplicated region transcript 4) genes on chromosome 17. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, one of which encodes a protein that shares sequence identity with the upstream gene product, but its C-terminus is distinct due to frameshifts relative to the downstream gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the p53 family of transcription factors involved in cellular responses to stress and development. It maps to a region on chromosome 1p36 that is frequently deleted in neuroblastoma and other tumors, and thought to contain multiple tumor suppressor genes. The demonstration that this gene is monoallelically expressed (likely from the maternal allele), supports the notion that it is a candidate gene for neuroblastoma. Many transcript variants resulting from alternative splicing and/or use of alternate promoters have been found for this gene, but the biological validity and the full-length nature of some variants have not been determined.","Variant counts

Summary
B cell-activating factor (BAFF) enhances B-cell survival in vitro and is a regulator of the peripheral B-cell population. Overexpression of Baff in mice results in mature B-cell hyperplasia and symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Also, some SLE patients have increased levels of BAFF in serum. Therefore, it has been proposed that abnormally high levels of BAFF may contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases by enhancing the survival of autoreactive B cells. The protein encoded by this gene is a receptor for BAFF and is a type III transmembrane protein containing a single extracellular cysteine-rich domain. It is thought that this receptor is the principal receptor required for BAFF-mediated mature B-cell survival.","Variant counts

The four human glycoprotein hormones chorionic gonadotropin (CG), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) are dimers consisting of alpha and beta subunits that are associated noncovalently. The alpha subunits of these hormones are identical, however, their beta chains are unique and confer biological specificity. Thyroid stimulating hormone functions in the control of thyroid structure and metabolism. The protein encoded by this gene is the beta subunit of thyroid stimulating hormone. Mutations in this gene are associated with congenital central and secondary hypothyroidism and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a trypsin-like serine protease released from the submucosal serous glands onto mucous membrane. It is a type II integral membrane protein and has 29-38% identity in the sequence of the catalytic region with human hepsin, enteropeptidase, acrosin, and mast cell tryptase. The noncatalytic region has little similarity to other known proteins. This protein may play some biological role in the host defense system on the mucous membrane independently of or in cooperation with other substances in airway mucous or bronchial secretions.","Variant counts

Summary
Transaldolase 1 is a key enzyme of the nonoxidative pentose phosphate pathway providing ribose-5-phosphate for nucleic acid synthesis and NADPH for lipid biosynthesis. This pathway can also maintain glutathione at a reduced state and thus protect sulfhydryl groups and cellular integrity from oxygen radicals. The functional gene of transaldolase 1 is located on chromosome 11 and a pseudogene is identified on chromosome 1 but there are conflicting map locations. The second and third exon of this gene were developed by insertion of a retrotransposable element. This gene is thought to be involved in multiple sclerosis.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of a phylogenetically conserved family of genes that share a common DNA-binding domain, the T-box. T-box genes encode transcription factors involved in the regulation of developmental processes. This gene is the human ortholog of mouse Tbx21/Tbet gene. Studies in mouse show that Tbx21 protein is a Th1 cell-specific transcription factor that controls the expression of the hallmark Th1 cytokine, interferon-gamma (IFNG). Expression of the human ortholog also correlates with IFNG expression in Th1 and natural killer cells, suggesting a role for this gene in initiating Th1 lineage development from naive Th precursor cells.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor that controls the ability to taste glucosinolates, a family of bitter-tasting compounds found in plants of the Brassica sp. Synthetic compounds phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) and 6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP) have been identified as ligands for this receptor and have been used to test the genetic diversity of this gene. Although several allelic forms of this gene have been identified worldwide, there are two predominant common forms (taster and non-taster) found outside of Africa. These alleles differ at three nucleotide positions resulting in amino acid changes in the protein (A49P, A262V, and V296I) with the amino acid combination PAV identifying the taster variant (and AVI identifying the non-taster variant).","Variant counts

Summary
Initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II requires the activities of more than 70 polypeptides. The protein that coordinates these activities is transcription factor IID (TFIID), which binds to the core promoter to position the polymerase properly, serves as the scaffold for assembly of the remainder of the transcription complex, and acts as a channel for regulatory signals. TFIID is composed of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and a group of evolutionarily conserved proteins known as TBP-associated factors or TAFs. TAFs may participate in basal transcription, serve as coactivators, function in promoter recognition or modify general transcription factors (GTFs) to facilitate complex assembly and transcription initiation. This gene encodes TBP, the TATA-binding protein. A distinctive feature of TBP is a long string of glutamines in the N-terminus. This region of the protein modulates the DNA binding activity of the C terminus, and modulation of DNA binding affects the rate of transcription complex formation and initiation of transcription. The number of CAG repeats encoding the polyglutamine tract is usually 25-42, and expansion of the number of repeats to 45-66 increases the length of the polyglutamine string and is associated with spinocerebellar ataxia 17, a neurodegenerative disorder classified as a polyglutamine disease. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is one of several tumor-suppressing subtransferable fragments located in the imprinted gene domain of 11p15.5, an important tumor-suppressor gene region. Alterations in this region have been associated with the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Wilms tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, adrenocortical carcinoma, and lung, ovarian, and breast cancer. This gene is located among several imprinted genes; however, this gene, as well as the pan-hematopoietic expression gene (PHEMX), escapes imprinting. This gene may play a role in malignancies and disease that involve this region. Several transcript variants encoding two different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes one of the proteins of the shelterin, or telosome, complex which protects telomeres by allowing the cell to distinguish between telomeres and regions of DNA damage. The protein encoded by this gene is a critical part of shelterin; it interacts with the three DNA-binding proteins of the shelterin complex, and it is important for assembly of the complex. Mutations in this gene cause dyskeratosis congenita (DKC), an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the Groucho/ transducin-like Enhancer of split family of transcriptional co-repressors. The encoded protein is a component of the mammalian subcortical maternal complex, which is required for preimplantation development. In mouse, knock out of this gene results in cleavage-stage embryonic arrest resulting from defective cytoplasmic F-actin meshwork formation and asymmetric cell division. In human, an allelic variant in this gene is associated with preimplantation embryonic lethality. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Microtubules of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton perform essential and diverse functions and are composed of a heterodimer of alpha and beta tubulin. The genes encoding these microtubule constituents are part of the tubulin superfamily, which is composed of six distinct families. Genes from the alpha, beta and gamma tubulin families are found in all eukaryotes. The alpha and beta tubulins represent the major components of microtubules, while gamma tubulin plays a critical role in the nucleation of microtubule assembly. There are multiple alpha and beta tubulin genes and they are highly conserved among and between species. This gene is an alpha tubulin gene that encodes a protein 99% identical to the mouse testis-specific Tuba3 and Tuba7 gene products. This gene is located in the 13q11 region, which is associated with the genetic diseases Clouston hidrotic ectodermal dysplasia and Kabuki syndrome.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a member of the tripartite motif-containing protein family, whose members are characterized by a 'really interesting new gene' (RING) finger domain, a zinc-binding B-box motif, and a coiled-coil region. Members of this family function as E3 ubiquitin ligases and are involved in a broad range of biological processes. This gene regulates the activation of nuclear receptors, such as androgen receptor, and has been implicated in development of prostate cancer cells, where its expression increases in response to a downregulation of microRNAs. In addition, this gene participates in viral defense regulation as a negative regulator of interferon-beta. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that that is targeted to the mitochondrion and modifies transfer RNAs (tRNAs) by adding a dimethylallyl group onto the adenine at position 37. This modification is important for maintaining the correct reading frame during protein translation. This gene is considered a tumor suppressor and its expression can decrease cell growth. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcripts variants, most of which are likely non-functional.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the TNF-receptor superfamily. This receptor is preferentially expressed in mature B lymphocytes, and may be important for B cell development and autoimmune response. This receptor has been shown to specifically bind to the tumor necrosis factor (ligand) superfamily, member 13b (TNFSF13B/TALL-1/BAFF), and to lead to NF-kappaB and MAPK8/JNK activation. This receptor also binds to various TRAF family members, and thus may transduce signals for cell survival and proliferation.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the TNF-receptor superfamily. This protein and TNF-receptor 1 form a heterocomplex that mediates the recruitment of two anti-apoptotic proteins, c-IAP1 and c-IAP2, which possess E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. The function of IAPs in TNF-receptor signalling is unknown, however, c-IAP1 is thought to potentiate TNF-induced apoptosis by the ubiquitination and degradation of TNF-receptor-associated factor 2, which mediates anti-apoptotic signals. Knockout studies in mice also suggest a role of this protein in protecting neurons from apoptosis by stimulating antioxidative pathways.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the TNF receptor superfamily of proteins. The encoded receptor is found in membrane-bound and soluble forms that interact with membrane-bound and soluble forms, respectively, of its ligand, tumor necrosis factor alpha. Binding of membrane-bound tumor necrosis factor alpha to the membrane-bound receptor induces receptor trimerization and activation, which plays a role in cell survival, apoptosis, and inflammation. Proteolytic processing of the encoded receptor results in release of the soluble form of the receptor, which can interact with free tumor necrosis factor alpha to inhibit inflammation. Mutations in this gene underlie tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), characterized by fever, abdominal pain and other features. Mutations in this gene may also be associated with multiple sclerosis in human patients.","Variant counts

Summary
Initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II requires the activities of more than 70 polypeptides. The protein that coordinates these activities is transcription factor IID (TFIID), which binds to the core promoter to position the polymerase properly, serves as the scaffold for assembly of the remainder of the transcription complex, and acts as a channel for regulatory signals. TFIID is composed of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and a group of evolutionarily conserved proteins known as TBP-associated factors or TAFs. TAFs may participate in basal transcription, serve as coactivators, function in promoter recognition or modify general transcription factors (GTFs) to facilitate complex assembly and transcription initiation. This gene encodes a protein that is a component of the PCAF histone acetylase complex and structurally similar to one of the histone-like TAFs, TAF6. The PCAF histone acetylase complex, which is composed of more than 20 polypeptides some of which are TAFs, is required for myogenic transcription and differentiation.","Variant counts

Summary
Megakaryocytopoiesis is the cellular development process that leads to platelet production. The main functional protein encoded by this gene is a humoral growth factor that is necessary for megakaryocyte proliferation and maturation, as well as for thrombopoiesis. This protein is the ligand for MLP/C_MPL, the product of myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene. Mutations in this gene are the cause of thrombocythemia 1. Alternative promoter usage and differential splicing result in multiple transcript variants differing in the 5' UTR and/or coding region. Multiple AUG codons upstream of the main open reading frame (ORF) have been identified, and these upstream AUGs inhibit translation of the main ORF at different extent.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene has sequence similarity with members of the WD40 repeat-containing protein family. The WD40 group is a large family of proteins, which appear to have a regulatory function. It is believed that the WD40 repeats mediate protein-protein interactions and members of the family are involved in signal transduction, RNA processing, gene regulation, vesicular trafficking, cytoskeletal assembly and may play a role in the control of cytotypic differentiation. This encoded protein is found as a subunit in corepressor SMRT (silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid receptors) complex along with histone deacetylase 3 protein. This gene is located adjacent to the ocular albinism gene and it is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of the ocular albinism with late-onset sensorineural deafness phenotype. Four transcript variants encoding two different isoforms have been found for this gene. This gene is highly similar to the Y chromosome TBL1Y gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The product of this gene functions in the NF-kappaB signal transduction pathway. The encoded protein, and the similar and functionally redundant protein MAP3K7IP2/TAB2, forms a ternary complex with the protein kinase MAP3K7/TAK1 and either TRAF2 or TRAF6 in response to stimulation with the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF or IL-1. Subsequent MAP3K7/TAK1 kinase activity triggers a signaling cascade leading to activation of the NF-kappaB transcription factor. The human genome contains a related pseudogene. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described, but their biological validity has not been determined.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is an activator of MAP3K7/TAK1, which is required for for the IL-1 induced activation of nuclear factor kappaB and MAPK8/JNK. This protein forms a kinase complex with TRAF6, MAP3K7 and TAB1, and it thus serves as an adaptor that links MAP3K7 and TRAF6. This protein, along with TAB1 and MAP3K7, also participates in the signal transduction induced by TNFSF11/RANKl through the activation of the receptor activator of NF-kappaB (TNFRSF11A/RANK), which may regulate the development and function of osteoclasts. Studies of the related mouse protein indicate that it functions to protect against liver damage caused by chemical stressors. Mutations in this gene cause congenital heart defects, multiple types, 2 (CHTD2). Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene was identified as a regulator of the MAP kinase kinase kinase MAP3K7/TAK1, which is known to mediate various intracellular signaling pathways, such as those induced by TGF beta, interleukin 1, and WNT-1. This protein interacts and thus activates TAK1 kinase. It has been shown that the C-terminal portion of this protein is sufficient for binding and activation of TAK1, while a portion of the N-terminus acts as a dominant-negative inhibitor of TGF beta, suggesting that this protein may function as a mediator between TGF beta receptors and TAK1. This protein can also interact with and activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 (MAPK14/p38alpha), and thus represents an alternative activation pathway, in addition to the MAPKK pathways, which contributes to the biological responses of MAPK14 to various stimuli. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been reported.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the WD40 repeat-containing gene family and shares sequence similarity with transducin (beta)-like 1X-linked (TBL1X). The protein encoded by this gene is thought to be a component of both nuclear receptor corepressor (N-CoR) and histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC 3) complexes, and is required for transcriptional activation by a variety of transcription factors. Mutations in these gene have been associated with some autism spectrum disorders, and one finding suggests that haploinsufficiency of this gene may be a cause of intellectual disability with dysmorphism. Mutations in this gene as well as recurrent translocations involving this gene have also been observed in some tumors.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family which plays a fundamental role in pathogen recognition and activation of innate immunity. TLRs are highly conserved from Drosophila to humans and share structural and functional similarities. This protein is a cell-surface protein that can form heterodimers with other TLR family members to recognize conserved molecules derived from microorganisms known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Activation of TLRs by PAMPs leads to an up-regulation of signaling pathways to modulate the host's inflammatory response. This gene is also thought to promote apoptosis in response to bacterial lipoproteins. This gene has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

TLRs are highly conserved from Drosophila to humans and share structural and functional similarities. They recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are expressed on infectious agents, and mediate the production of cytokines necessary for the development of effective immunity. The various TLRs exhibit different patterns of expression. This receptor is most abundantly expressed in placenta and pancreas, and is restricted to the dendritic subpopulation of the leukocytes. It recognizes dsRNA associated with viral infection, and induces the activation of NF-kappaB and the production of type I interferons. It may thus play a role in host defense against viruses. Use of alternative polyadenylation sites to generate different length transcripts has been noted for this gene.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family which plays a fundamental role in pathogen recognition and activation of innate immunity. TLRs are highly conserved from Drosophila to humans and share structural and functional similarities. The human TLR family comprises 11 members. They recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are expressed on infectious agents, and mediate the production of cytokines necessary for the development of effective immunity. For the recognition of structural components in foreign microorganisms, the various TLRs exhibit different patterns of expression as well; in this way for example, TLR-3, -7, and -8 are essential in the recognition of single-stranded RNA viruses. TLR7 senses single-stranded RNA oligonucleotides containing guanosine- and uridine-rich sequences from RNA viruses, a recognition occuring in the endosomes of plasmacytoid dendritic cells and B cells. This gene is predominantly expressed in lung, placenta, and spleen, and is phylogenetically related and lies in close proximity to another family member, TLR8, on chromosome X.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the toll-like receptor (TLR) family, which plays a fundamental role in pathogen recognition and activation of innate immune responses. These receptors recognize distinct pathogen-associated molecular patterns that are expressed on infectious agents. The protein encoded by this gene recognizes bacterial flagellin, the principal component of bacterial flagella and a virulence factor. The activation of this receptor mobilizes the nuclear factor NF-kappaB, which in turn activates a host of inflammatory-related target genes. Mutations in this gene have been associated with both resistance and susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus, and susceptibility to Legionnaire disease.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family which plays a fundamental role in pathogen recognition and activation of innate immunity. TLRs are highly conserved from Drosophila to humans and share structural and functional similarities. They recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are expressed on infectious agents, and mediate the production of cytokines necessary for the development of effective immunity. The various TLRs exhibit different patterns of expression. This gene is predominantly expressed in lung and peripheral blood leukocytes, and lies in close proximity to another family member, TLR7, on chromosome X.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix domain-containing transcription factor that binds MUE3-type E-box sequences in the promoter of genes. The encoded protein promotes the expression of genes downstream of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling. This gene may be involved in chromosomal translocations in renal cell carcinomas and other cancers, resulting in the production of fusion proteins. Translocation partners include PRCC (papillary renal cell carcinoma), NONO (non-POU domain containing, octamer-binding), and ASPSCR1 (alveolar soft part sarcoma chromosome region, candidate 1), among other genes. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the micropthalmia (MiT) family of basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper transcription factors. MiT transcription factors regulate the expression of target genes by binding to E-box recognition sequences as homo- or heterodimers, and play roles in multiple cellular processes including survival, growth and differentiation. The encoded protein is a transcriptional activator of the nonmuscle myosin II heavy chain-A gene, and may also co-regulate target genes in osteoclasts as a heterodimer with micropthalmia-associated transcription factor. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes an adapter protein involved in adaptive and innate immunity. This protein includes a forkhead-associated (FHA) domain that specifically binds to phosphorylated serine and threonine residues. In response to bacterial infection, the encoded host cell protein undergoes an intermolecular interaction between the FHA domain and a phosphorylated threonine that leads to protein oligomerization and stimulation of the NF-kappa B and other downstream signaling pathways. This protein exhibits reduced expression in hepatocellular carcinoma and may suppress hepatocellular carcinoma progression. This protein may also play a role in the DNA damage response.","Variant counts

This gene is a member of a phylogenetically conserved family of genes that share a common DNA-binding domain, the T-box. T-box genes encode transcription factors involved in the regulation of developmental processes. This gene is the human homolog of mouse Tbx4, which is closely linked to Tbx2 on mouse chromosome 11. Similarly this gene, like TBX2, maps to human chromosome 17. Expression studies in mouse and chicken show that Tbx4 is expressed in developing hindlimb, but not in forelimb buds, suggesting a role for this gene in regulating limb development and specification of limb identity.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a tRNA-modifying enzyme that acts as a dimethyltransferase, modifying a single guanine residue at position 26 of the tRNA. The encoded enzyme has both mono- and dimethylase activity when exogenously expressed, and uses S-adenosyl methionine as a methyl donor. The C-terminal region of the encoded protein has both a zinc finger motif, and an arginine/proline-rich region. Mutations in this gene have been implicated in autosomal recessive intellectual disorder (ARID). Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. There is a pseudogene of this gene on the X chromosome.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the evolutionarily conserved TIMM (translocase of inner mitochondrial membrane) family of proteins that function as chaperones in the import of proteins from the cytoplasm into the mitochondrial inner membrane. Proteins of this family play a role in collecting substrate proteins from the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM) complex and delivering them to either the sorting and assembly machinery in the outer mitochondrial membrane (SAM) complex or the TIMM22 complex in the inner mitochondrial membrane. The encoded protein and the translocase of mitochondrial inner membrane 8a protein form a 70 kDa complex in the intermembrane space.","Variant counts

Summary
Initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II requires the activities of more than 70 polypeptides. The protein that coordinates these activities is transcription factor IID (TFIID), which binds to the core promoter to position the polymerase properly, serves as the scaffold for assembly of the remainder of the transcription complex, and acts as a channel for regulatory signals. TFIID is composed of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and a group of evolutionarily conserved proteins known as TBP-associated factors or TAFs. TAFs may participate in basal transcription, serve as coactivators, function in promoter recognition or modify general transcription factors (GTFs) to facilitate complex assembly and transcription initiation. This gene encodes one of the larger subunits of TFIID that has been shown to potentiate transcriptional activation by retinoic acid, thyroid hormone and vitamin D3 receptors. In addition, this subunit interacts with the transcription factor CREB, which has a glutamine-rich activation domain, and binds to other proteins containing glutamine-rich regions. Aberrant binding to this subunit by proteins with expanded polyglutamine regions has been suggested as one of the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying a group of neurodegenerative disorders referred to as polyglutamine diseases.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor that regulates the tissue factor (TF)-dependent pathway of blood coagulation. The coagulation process initiates with the formation of a factor VIIa-TF complex, which proteolytically activates additional proteases (factors IX and X) and ultimately leads to the formation of a fibrin clot. The product of this gene inhibits the activated factor X and VIIa-TF proteases in an autoregulatory loop. Inhibition of the encoded protein restores hemostasis in animal models of hemophilia. This gene encodes multiple protein isoforms that differ in their inhibitory activity, specificity and cellular localization.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a component of the nuclear THO transcription elongation complex, which is part of the larger transcription export (TREX) complex that couples messenger RNA processing and export. In humans, the transcription export complex is recruited to the 5'-end of messenger RNAs in a splicing- and cap-dependent manner. Studies of a related complex in mouse suggest that the metazoan transcription export complex is involved in cell differentiation and development. A pseudogene of this gene has been defined on chromosome 5.","Variant counts

Summary
This locus represents naturally occurring read-through transcription between the neighboring transmembrane emp24 protein transport domain containing 7 (TMED7) and toll-like receptor adaptor molecule 2 (TICAM2) genes. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, one of which encodes a fusion protein that shares sequence identity with the products of each individual gene. This fusion product functions to negatively regulate the adaptor MyD88-independent toll-like receptor 4 pathway.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene was identified based on the interaction of its protein product with thyroid hormone receptor beta. This protein is associated with the Golgi apparatus. The N-terminal region of the protein binds Golgi membranes and the C-terminal region binds the minus ends of microtubules; thus, the protein is thought to play a role in assembly and maintenance of the Golgi ribbon structure around the centrosome. Mutations in this gene cause achondrogenesis type IA.","Variant counts

Summary
HIV-1, the causative agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), contains an RNA genome that produces a chromosomally integrated DNA during the replicative cycle. Activation of HIV-1 gene expression by the transactivator Tat is dependent on an RNA regulatory element (TAR) located downstream of the transcription initiation site. The protein encoded by this gene is a transcriptional repressor that binds to chromosomally integrated TAR DNA and represses HIV-1 transcription. In addition, this protein regulates alternate splicing of the CFTR gene. A similar pseudogene is present on chromosome 20.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes the beta subunit of the karyopherin receptor complex which interacts with nuclear localization signals to target nuclear proteins to the nucleus. The karyopherin receptor complex is a heterodimer of an alpha subunit which recognizes the nuclear localization signal and a beta subunit which docks the complex at nucleoporins. Alternate splicing of this gene results in several transcript variants encoding different proteins.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a glycoprotein that is restricted within the kidney to the basement membranes underlying the epithelium of Bowman's capsule and proximal and distal tubules. Autoantibodies against this protein are found in sera of patients with tubulointerstital nephritis, membranous nephropathy and anti-glomerular basement membrane nephritis. Ontogeny studies suggest that the expression of this antigen is developmentally regulated in a precise spatial and temporal pattern throughout nephrogenesis.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor that plays an important role in embryonic development. The encoded protein forms both homodimers and heterodimers that bind to DNA E box sequences and regulate the transcription of genes involved in cranial suture closure during skull development. This protein may also regulate neural tube closure, limb development and brown fat metabolism. This gene is hypermethylated and overexpressed in multiple human cancers, and the encoded protein promotes tumor cell invasion and metastasis, as well as metastatic recurrence. Mutations in this gene cause Saethre-Chotzen syndrome in human patients, which is characterized by craniosynostosis, ptosis and hypertelorism.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase family, and is a member of the thioredoxin (Trx) system. Three thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) isozymes are found in mammals. TrxRs are selenocysteine-containing flavoenzymes, which reduce thioredoxins, as well as other substrates, and play a key role in redox homoeostasis. This gene encodes a mitochondrial form important for scavenging reactive oxygen species in mitochondria. It functions as a homodimer containing FAD, and selenocysteine (Sec) at the active site. Sec is encoded by UGA codon that normally signals translation termination. The 3' UTRs of selenoprotein mRNAs contain a conserved stem-loop structure, the Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element, which is necessary for the recognition of UGA as a Sec codon rather than as a stop signal. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms, including a few localized in the cytosol and some lacking the C-terminal Sec residue, have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase family, and is a member of the thioredoxin (Trx) system. Three thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) isozymes are found in mammals. TrxRs are selenocysteine-containing flavoenzymes, which reduce thioredoxins, as well as other substrates, and play a key role in redox homoeostasis. This gene encodes the third TrxR, which unlike the other two isozymes, contains an additional N-terminal glutaredoxin (Grx) domain, and shows highest expression in testis. The Grx domain allows this isozyme to participate in both Trx and glutathione systems. It functions as a homodimer containing FAD, and selenocysteine (Sec) at the active site. Sec is encoded by UGA codon that normally signals translation termination. The 3' UTRs of selenoprotein mRNAs contain a conserved stem-loop structure, the Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element, which is necessary for the recognition of UGA as a Sec codon rather than as a stop signal. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. Experimental evidence suggests the use of a non-AUG (CUG) codon as a translation initiation codon (PMID:20018845).","Variant counts

Summary
Microtubules of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton perform essential and diverse functions and are composed of a heterodimer of alpha and beta tubulin. The genes encoding these microtubule constituents are part of the tubulin superfamily, which is composed of six distinct families. Genes from the alpha, beta and gamma tubulin families are found in all eukaryotes. The alpha and beta tubulins represent the major components of microtubules, while gamma tubulin plays a critical role in the nucleation of microtubule assembly. There are multiple alpha and beta tubulin genes and they are highly conserved among and between species. This gene encodes an alpha tubulin that is a highly conserved homolog of a rat testis-specific alpha tubulin. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
One of the two protein isoforms encoded by this gene is a type II integral membrane protein found in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The encoded protein is a cofactor for the ATPase TorsinA, regulating the amount of TorsinA present in the ER compared to that found in the nuclear envelope. Defects in this protein are a cause of early onset primary dystonia, a neuromuscular disease. The other isoform encoded by this gene is an interferon alpha responsive protein whose cellular role has yet to be determined.","Variant counts

Summary
Initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II requires the activities of more than 70 polypeptides. The protein that coordinates these activities is transcription factor IID (TFIID), which binds to the core promoter to position the polymerase properly, serves as the scaffold for assembly of the remainder of the transcription complex, and acts as a channel for regulatory signals. TFIID is composed of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and a group of evolutionarily conserved proteins known as TBP-associated factors or TAFs. TAFs may participate in basal transcription, serve as coactivators, function in promoter recognition or modify general transcription factors (GTFs) to facilitate complex assembly and transcription initiation. This gene encodes a small subunit associated with a subset of TFIID complexes. This subunit interacts with TBP and with two other small subunits of TFIID, TAF10 and TAF11. There is a pseudogene located on chromosome 6.","Variant counts

Summary
Control of transcription by RNA polymerase II involves the basal transcription machinery which is a collection of proteins. These proteins with RNA polymerase II, assemble into complexes which are modulated by transactivator proteins that bind to cis-regulatory elements located adjacent to the transcription start site. Some modulators interact directly with the basal complex, whereas others may act as bridging proteins linking transactivators to the basal transcription factors. Some of these associated factors are weakly attached while others are tightly associated with TBP in the TFIID complex. Among the latter are the TAF proteins. Different TAFs are predicted to mediate the function of distinct transcriptional activators for a variety of gene promoters and RNA polymerases. TAF12 interacts directly with TBP as well as with TAF2I. Two transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes one of the three prealbumins, which include alpha-1-antitrypsin, transthyretin and orosomucoid. The encoded protein, transthyretin, is a homo-tetrameric carrier protein, which transports thyroid hormones in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. It is also involved in the transport of retinol (vitamin A) in the plasma by associating with retinol-binding protein. The protein may also be involved in other intracellular processes including proteolysis, nerve regeneration, autophagy and glucose homeostasis. Mutations in this gene are associated with amyloid deposition, predominantly affecting peripheral nerves or the heart, while a small percentage of the gene mutations are non-amyloidogenic. The mutations are implicated in the etiology of several diseases, including amyloidotic polyneuropathy, euthyroid hyperthyroxinaemia, amyloidotic vitreous opacities, cardiomyopathy, oculoleptomeningeal amyloidosis, meningocerebrovascular amyloidosis and carpal tunnel syndrome.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a dual specificity protein kinase with the ability to phosphorylate tyrosine, serine and threonine. Associated with cell proliferation, this protein is essential for chromosome alignment at the centromere during mitosis and is required for centrosome duplication. It has been found to be a critical mitotic checkpoint protein for accurate segregation of chromosomes during mitosis. Tumorigenesis may occur when this protein fails to degrade and produces excess centrosomes resulting in aberrant mitotic spindles. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
TTL is a cytosolic enzyme involved in the posttranslational modification of alpha-tubulin (see MIM 602529). Alpha-tubulin within assembled microtubules is detyrosinated over time at the C terminus. After microtubule disassembly, TTL restores the tyrosine residues and consequently participates in a cycle of tubulin detyrosination and tyrosination (Erck et al., 2003 [PubMed 14571137]).","Variant counts

Summary
This gene belongs to the TMEM43 family. Defects in this gene are the cause of familial arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia type 5 (ARVD5), also known as arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy type 5 (ARVC5). Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia is an inherited disorder, often involving both ventricles, and is characterized by ventricular tachycardia, heart failure, sudden cardiac death, and fibrofatty replacement of cardiomyocytes. This gene contains a response element for PPAR gamma (an adipogenic transcription factor), which may explain the fibrofatty replacement of the myocardium, a characteristic pathological finding in ARVC.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein which mediates interaction between newly assembled major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules and the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP), which is required for the transport of antigenic peptides across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. This interaction is essential for optimal peptide loading on the MHC class I molecule. Up to four complexes of MHC class I and this protein may be bound to a single TAP molecule. This protein contains a C-terminal double-lysine motif (KKKAE) known to maintain membrane proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. This gene lies within the major histocompatibility complex on chromosome 6. Alternative splicing results in three transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family, whose members are involved in diverse cellular functions such as developmental patterning and oncogenesis. The TRIM motif includes zinc-binding domains, a RING finger region, a B-box motif and a coiled-coil domain. The RING finger and B-box domains chelate zinc and might be involved in protein-protein and/or protein-nucleic acid interactions. Mutations in this gene are associated with mulibrey (muscle-liver-brain-eye) nanism, an autosomal recessive disorder that involves several tissues of mesodermal origin. TRIM37 localizes in peroxisomal membranes, and has been implicated in human peroxisomal biogenesis disorders.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that belongs to the serine protease family. The encoded protein contains a type II transmembrane domain, a receptor class A domain, a scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domain and a protease domain. Serine proteases are known to be involved in many physiological and pathological processes. This gene was demonstrated to be up-regulated by androgenic hormones in prostate cancer cells and down-regulated in androgen-independent prostate cancer tissue. The protease domain of this protein is thought to be cleaved and secreted into cell media after autocleavage. This protein also facilitates entry of viruses into host cells by proteolytically cleaving and activating viral envelope glycoproteins. Viruses found to use this protein for cell entry include Influenza virus and the human coronaviruses HCoV-229E, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 virus). Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II requires the activities of more than 70 polypeptides. The protein that coordinates these activities is transcription factor IID (TFIID), which binds to the core promoter to position the polymerase properly, serves as the scaffold for assembly of the remainder of the transcription complex, and acts as a channel for regulatory signals. TFIID is composed of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and a group of evolutionarily conserved proteins known as TBP-associated factors or TAFs. TAFs may participate in basal transcription, serve as coactivators, function in promoter recognition or modify general transcription factors (GTFs) to facilitate complex assembly and transcription initiation. This gene encodes a protein that is similar to one of the small subunits of TFIID, TBP-associated factor 9, and is also a subunit of TFIID. TAF9 and TAF9b share some functions but also have distinct roles in the transcriptional regulatory process.","Variant counts

Summary
Troponin is a central regulatory protein of striated muscle contraction, and together with tropomyosin, is located on the actin filament. Troponin consists of 3 subunits: TnI, which is the inhibitor of actomyosin ATPase; TnT, which contains the binding site for tropomyosin; and TnC, the protein encoded by this gene. The binding of calcium to TnC abolishes the inhibitory action of TnI, thus allowing the interaction of actin with myosin, the hydrolysis of ATP, and the generation of tension. Mutations in this gene are associated with cardiomyopathy dilated type 1Z.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene belongs to the transient receptor family. It encodes one of the seven mammalian TRPC (transient receptor potential channel) proteins. The encoded protein is a multi-pass membrane protein and is thought to form a receptor-activated non-selective calcium permeant cation channel. The protein is active alone or as a heteromultimeric assembly with TRPC1, TRPC3, and TRPC4. It also interacts with multiple proteins including calmodulin, CABP1, enkurin, Na(+)-H+ exchange regulatory factor (NHERF ), interferon-induced GTP-binding protein (MX1), ring finger protein 24 (RNF24), and SEC14 domain and spectrin repeat-containing protein 1 (SESTD1).","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that is a regulator of cellular growth and proliferation. Its mRNA is highly structured and contains an oligopyrimidine tract (5'-TOP) in its 5' untranslated region that functions to repress its translation under quiescent conditions. The encoded protein is involved in a variety of cellular pathways, including apoptosis, protein synthesis and cell division. It binds to and stabilizes microtubules, and removal of this protein through phosphorylation is required for progression through mitotic and meiotic cell divisions. This gene is known to play a role in carcinogenesis, and is upregulated in some cancer cells. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
The product encoded by this gene is a member of a RNA-binding protein family and possesses nucleolytic activity against cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTL) target cells. It has been suggested that this protein may be involved in the induction of apoptosis as it preferentially recognizes poly(A) homopolymers and induces DNA fragmentation in CTL targets. The major granule-associated species is a 15-kDa protein that is thought to be derived from the carboxyl terminus of the 40-kDa product by proteolytic processing. Alternative splicing resulting in different isoforms has been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a transmembrane signaling polypeptide which contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in its cytoplasmic domain. The encoded protein may associate with the killer-cell inhibitory receptor (KIR) family of membrane glycoproteins and may act as an activating signal transduction element. This protein may bind zeta-chain (TCR) associated protein kinase 70kDa (ZAP-70) and spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) and play a role in signal transduction, bone modeling, brain myelination, and inflammation. Mutations within this gene have been associated with polycystic lipomembranous osteodysplasia with sclerosing leukoencephalopathy (PLOSL), also known as Nasu-Hakola disease. Its putative receptor, triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), also causes PLOSL. Multiple alternative transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been identified for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The product of this gene is one of four proteins (cofactors A, D, E, and C) involved in the pathway leading to correctly folded beta-tubulin from folding intermediates. Cofactors A and D are believed to play a role in capturing and stabilizing beta-tubulin intermediates in a quasi-native confirmation. Cofactor E binds to the cofactor D/beta-tubulin complex; interaction with cofactor C then causes the release of beta-tubulin polypeptides that are committed to the native state. This gene encodes chaperonin cofactor A. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a component of the gamma-tubulin ring complex, which is required for microtubule nucleation. In mammalian cells, the protein localizes to centrosomes in association with gamma-tubulin. Crystal structure analysis revealed a structure composed of five helical bundles arranged around conserved hydrophobic cores. An exposed surface area located in the C-terminal domain is essential and sufficient for direct binding to gamma-tubulin. Mutations in this gene that alter microtubule organization are associated with microcephaly and chorioretinopathy. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR) superfamily, and is thought to contain a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) binding domain. This large SDR family of enzymes is involved in the metabolism of a variety of compounds, including prostaglandins, retinoids, lipids, steroid hormones, and xenobiotics. Mutations in this gene have been associated with Catel-Manzke syndrome, which is characterized by Pierre Robin sequence, and radial deviation of the index finger due to the presence of an accessory bone between the index finger and its proximal phalanx. Pierre Robin sequence is defined by an undersized jaw, backwards displacement of the tongue base that causes an obstruction of the airways, and can also be associated with a cleft palate. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the TNF-receptor superfamily. This receptors can interact with various TRAF family proteins, through which this receptor induces the activation of NF-kappa B and MAPK8/JNK. This receptor and its ligand are important regulators of the interaction between T cells and dendritic cells. This receptor is also an essential mediator for osteoclast and lymph node development. Mutations at this locus have been associated with familial expansile osteolysis, autosomal recessive osteopetrosis, and Paget disease of bone. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described for this locus.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the TNF-receptor superfamily. This protein is an osteoblast-secreted decoy receptor that functions as a negative regulator of bone resorption. This protein specifically binds to its ligand, osteoprotegerin ligand, both of which are key extracellular regulators of osteoclast development. Studies of the mouse counterpart also suggest that this protein and its ligand play a role in lymph-node organogenesis and vascular calcification. Alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been reported, but their full length nature has not been determined.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a DNA-binding homeobox protein and a transcriptional repressor, which appears to repress transcription by recruiting histone deacetylases to TGF beta-responsive genes. This gene is amplified and over-expressed in some ovarian cancers. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. A related pseudogene has been identified on chromosome 1. Read-through transcription also exists between this gene and the neighboring downstream C20orf24 (chromosome 20 open reading frame 24) gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the three-amino acid loop extension (TALE) superclass of atypical homeodomains. TALE homeobox proteins are highly conserved transcription regulators. This particular homeodomain binds to a previously characterized retinoid X receptor responsive element from the cellular retinol-binding protein II promoter. In addition to its role in inhibiting 9-cis-retinoic acid-dependent RXR alpha transcription activation of the retinoic acid responsive element, the protein is an active transcriptional co-repressor of SMAD2 and may participate in the transmission of nuclear signals during development and in the adult. Mutations in this gene are associated with holoprosencephaly type 4, which is a structural anomaly of the brain. Alternative splicing has been observed at this locus and multiple splice variants encoding distinct isoforms are described.","Variant counts
