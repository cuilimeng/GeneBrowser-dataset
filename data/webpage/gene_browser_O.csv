Summary
This gene encodes the rate-limiting enzyme of the polyamine biosynthesis pathway which catalyzes ornithine to putrescine. The activity level for the enzyme varies in response to growth-promoting stimuli and exhibits a high turnover rate in comparison to other mammalian proteins. Originally localized to both chromosomes 2 and 7, the gene encoding this enzyme has been determined to be located on 2p25, with a pseudogene located on 7q31-qter. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been identified.","Variant counts

The encoded enzyme specifically recognizes and removes M1(Met1)-linked, or linear, ubiquitin chains from protein substrates. Linear ubiquitin chains are known to regulate the NF-kappa B signaling pathway in the context of immunity and inflammation. Mutations in this gene cause a potentially fatal autoinflammatory syndrome in human patients.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes for a light absorbing visual pigment of the opsin gene family. The encoded protein is called green cone photopigment or medium-wavelength sensitive opsin. Opsins are G-protein coupled receptors with seven transmembrane domains, an N-terminal extracellular domain, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. The long-wavelength opsin gene and multiple copies of the medium-wavelength opsin gene are tandemly arrayed on the X chromosome and frequent unequal recombination and gene conversion may occur between these sequences. X chromosomes may have fusions of the medium- and long-wavelength opsin genes or may have more than one copy of these genes. Defects in this gene are the cause of deutanopic colorblindness.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes the coiled-coil containing protein optineurin. Optineurin may play a role in normal-tension glaucoma and adult-onset primary open angle glaucoma. Optineurin interacts with adenovirus E3-14.7K protein and may utilize tumor necrosis factor-alpha or Fas-ligand pathways to mediate apoptosis, inflammation or vasoconstriction. Optineurin may also function in cellular morphogenesis and membrane trafficking, vesicle trafficking, and transcription activation through its interactions with the RAB8, huntingtin, and transcription factor IIIA proteins. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding the same protein.","Variant counts

Summary
Opticin belongs to class III of the small leucine-rich repeat protein (SLRP) family. Members of this family are typically associated with the extracellular matrix. Opticin is present in significant quantities in the vitreous of the eye and also localizes to the cornea, iris, ciliary body, optic nerve, choroid, retina, and fetal liver. Opticin may noncovalently bind collagen fibrils and regulate fibril morphology, spacing, and organization. The opticin gene is mapped to a region of chromosome 1 that is associated with the inherited eye diseases age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and posterior column ataxia with retinosa pigmentosa (AXPC1).","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes the human homolog of the mouse p (pink-eyed dilution) gene. The encoded protein is believed to be an integral membrane protein involved in small molecule transport, specifically tyrosine, which is a precursor to melanin synthesis. It is involved in mammalian pigmentation, where it may control skin color variation and act as a determinant of brown or blue eye color. Mutations in this gene result in type 2 oculocutaneous albinism. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that may be involved in the degradation of G proteins via the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway. The encoded protein binds to members of subfamily A of the regulator of the G-protein signaling (RGS) family through an N-terminal leucine-rich region. This protein also has a central RING finger-like domain and E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. This protein is highly conserved from flies to humans. Defects in this gene may cause the autosomal recessive, infantile malignant form of osteopetrosis.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a transmembrane protein which belongs to the otopetrin domain protein family and is required for the formation of otoconia and otoliths, calcium carbonate biominerals within the inner ear of mammals that are required for the detection of linear acceleration and gravity. This gene modulates purinergic control of intracellular calcium in vestibular supporting cells. Naturally occurring mutations in the orthologous mouse gene are associated with nonsyndromic otoconia agenesis and a consequent balance defect. The orthologous mouse gene is also induced in white adipose tissue during obesity. The encoded protein is a component of a counterinflammatory pathway that attenuates obesity-induced adipose tissue inflammation and plays an adaptive role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis in obesity.","Variant counts

Summary
Osteoclasts are multinucleated cells that resorb bone and are essential for bone homeostasis. This gene encodes an osteoclast-associated receptor (OSCAR), which is a member of the leukocyte receptor complex protein family that plays critical roles in the regulation of both innate and adaptive immune responses. The encoded protein may play a role in oxidative stress-mediated atherogenesis as well as monocyte adhesion. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a glycosyltransferase that catalyzes the addition of a single N-acetylglucosamine in O-glycosidic linkage to serine or threonine residues. Since both phosphorylation and glycosylation compete for similar serine or threonine residues, the two processes may compete for sites, or they may alter the substrate specificity of nearby sites by steric or electrostatic effects. The protein contains multiple tetratricopeptide repeats that are required for optimal recognition of substrates. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The outer dense fibers are cytoskeletal structures that surround the axoneme in the middle piece and principal piece of the sperm tail. The fibers function in maintaining the elastic structure and recoil of the sperm tail as well as in protecting the tail from shear forces during epididymal transport and ejaculation. Defects in the outer dense fibers lead to abnormal sperm morphology and infertility. This gene encodes one of the major outer dense fiber proteins. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. The longer transcripts, also known as 'Cenexins', encode proteins with a C-terminal extension that are differentially targeted to somatic centrioles and thought to be crucial for the formation of microtubule organizing centers.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a member of the leukemia inhibitory factor/oncostatin-M (LIF/OSM) family of proteins. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate the mature protein. This protein is a secreted cytokine and growth regulator that inhibits the proliferation of a number of tumor cell lines. This protein also regulates the production of other cytokines, including interleukin 6, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor in endothelial cells. This gene and the related gene, leukemia inhibitory factor, also present on chromosome 22, may have resulted from the duplication of a common ancestral gene. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, at least one of which encodes an isoform that is proteolytically processed.","Variant counts

Summary
The product of this gene is a member of the OTU (ovarian tumor) superfamily of predicted cysteine proteases. The encoded protein is a highly specific ubiquitin iso-peptidase, and cleaves ubiquitin from branched poly-ubiquitin chains but not from ubiquitinated substrates. It interacts with another ubiquitin protease and an E3 ubiquitin ligase that inhibits cytokine gene transcription in the immune system. It is proposed to function in specific ubiquitin-dependent pathways, possibly by providing an editing function for polyubiquitin chain growth. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the ornithine decarboxylase antizyme family, which plays a role in cell growth and proliferation by regulating intracellular polyamines. Expression of antizymes requires +1 ribosomal frameshifting, which is enhanced by high levels of polyamines. Antizymes in turn bind to and inhibit ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), the key enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis; thus, completing the auto-regulatory circuit. This gene encodes antizyme 2, the second member of the antizyme family. Like antizyme 1, antizyme 2 has broad tissue distribution, inhibits ODC activity and polyamine uptake, and stimulates ODC degradation in vivo; however, it fails to promote ODC degradation in vitro. Antizyme 2 is expressed at lower levels than antizyme 1, but is evolutionary more conserved, suggesting it likely has an important biological role. Studies also show different subcellular localization of antizymes 1 and 2, indicating specific function for each antizyme in discrete compartments of the cell. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the ornithine decarboxylase antizyme family, which plays a role in cell growth and proliferation by regulating intracellular polyamine levels. Expression of antizymes requires +1 ribosomal frameshifting, which is enhanced by high levels of polyamines. Antizymes in turn bind to and inhibit ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), the key enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis; thus, completing the auto-regulatory circuit. This gene encodes antizyme 3, the third member of the antizyme family. Like antizymes 1 and 2, antizyme 3 inhibits ODC activity and polyamine uptake; however, it does not stimulate ODC degradation. Also, while antizymes 1 and 2 have broad tissue distribution, expression of antizyme 3 is restricted to haploid germ cells in testis, suggesting a distinct role for this antizyme in spermiogenesis. Antizyme 3 gene knockout studies showed that homozygous mutant male mice were infertile, and indicated the likely role of this antizyme in the formation of a rigid connection between the sperm head and tail during spermatogenesis. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms, including one resulting from the use of non-AUG (CUG) translation initiation codon, have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Antizymes in turn bind to and inhibit ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), the key enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis; thus, completing the auto-regulatory circuit. This gene encodes antizyme 1, the first member of the antizyme family, that has broad tissue distribution, and negatively regulates intracellular polyamine levels by binding to and targeting ODC for degradation, as well as inhibiting polyamine uptake. Antizyme 1 mRNA contains two potential in-frame AUGs; and studies in rat suggest that alternative use of the two translation initiation sites results in N-terminally distinct protein isoforms with different subcellular localization. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have also been noted for this gene.","Variant counts

The encoded protein is a secreted extracellular matrix glycoprotein with a C-terminal olfactomedin domain that facilitates protein-protein interactions, cell adhesion, and intercellular interactions. It serves as both a scaffold protein that recruits bone morphogenetic protein 1 to its substrate chordin, and as a vascular tissue remodeler with pro-angiogenic properties. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

However, this gene is downregulated by SNAIL1 in hepatocellular carcinoma cells, contributing to their progression and malignancy.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the proline-rich protein family. The encoded protein has multiple proposed functions, including roles in pain suppression, penile erection, and protection of the eye surface. The QRFSR pentapeptide, known as opiorphin, is derived from the N-terminal of this protein. Opiorphin inhibits the enkephalin-inactivating peptidases neprilysin and aminopeptidase N, and this activity is thought to reduce sensitivity to painful stimuli by effecting enkephalin-related activation of opioid-dependent pathways. Opiorphin may also act as an anti-depressant. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes an opioid receptor, which is a member of the 7 transmembrane-spanning G protein-coupled receptor family. It functions as a receptor for endogenous ligands, as well as a receptor for various synthetic opioids. Ligand binding results in inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity and neurotransmitter release. This opioid receptor plays a role in the perception of pain and mediating the hypolocomotor, analgesic and aversive actions of synthetic opioids. Variations in this gene have also been associated with alcohol dependence and opiate addiction. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. A recent study provided evidence for translational readthrough in this gene, and expression of an additional C-terminally extended isoform via the use of an alternative in-frame translation termination codon.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that belongs to the oxoglutarate receptor family within the GPCR superfamily. The encoded protein is activated by the citric acid intermediate, oxoglutarate, as well as several cysteinyl leukotrienes, including leukotrienes E4, C4 and D4, which are implicated in many inflammatory disorders. In mice, a knock-out of this gene leads to middle ear inflammation, changes in the mucosal epithelium, and an increase in fluid behind the eardrum, and is associated with hearing loss. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes an inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase. This protein is involved in regulating membrane trafficking and is located in numerous subcellular locations including the trans-Golgi network, clathrin-coated vesicles and, endosomes and the plasma membrane. This protein may also play a role in primary cilium formation. Mutations in this gene cause oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe and also Dent disease. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a low density lipoprotein receptor that belongs to the C-type lectin superfamily. This gene is regulated through the cyclic AMP signaling pathway. The encoded protein binds, internalizes and degrades oxidized low-density lipoprotein. This protein may be involved in the regulation of Fas-induced apoptosis. This protein may play a role as a scavenger receptor. Mutations of this gene have been associated with atherosclerosis, risk of myocardial infarction, and may modify the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes one subunit of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. This complex catalyzes the overall conversion of 2-oxoglutarate (alpha-ketoglutarate) to succinyl-CoA and CO(2) during the Krebs cycle. The protein is located in the mitochondrial matrix and uses thiamine pyrophosphate as a cofactor. A congenital deficiency in 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase activity is believed to lead to hypotonia, metabolic acidosis, and hyperlactatemia. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the Cut homeobox family of transcription factors. Expression of the encoded protein is enriched in the liver, where it stimulates transcription of liver-expressed genes, and antagonizes glucocorticoid-stimulated gene transcription. This gene may influence a variety of cellular processes including glucose metabolism, cell cycle regulation, and it may also be associated with cancer. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Olfactory marker protein is uniquely associated with the mature olfactory receptor neurons in many vertebrate species from fish to man. The OMP gene structure and protein sequence are highly conserved between mouse, rat and human. Results of the mouse knockout studies show that OMP-null mice are compromised in their ability to respond to odor stimuli, and that OMP represents a novel modulatory component of the odor detection/signal transduction cascade.","Variant counts

Summary
Olfactory receptors interact with odorant molecules in the nose, to initiate a neuronal response that triggers the perception of a smell. The olfactory receptor proteins are members of a large family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) arising from single coding-exon genes. Olfactory receptors share a 7-transmembrane domain structure with many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors and are responsible for the recognition and G protein-mediated transduction of odorant signals. The olfactory receptor gene family is the largest in the genome.

The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the otogelin family. This gene is expressed in the inner ear of vertebrates with the highest level of expression seen at the embryonic stage and lowest in adult. Knockdown studies in zebrafish suggest that this gene is essential for normal inner ear function. Mutations in this gene are associated with autosomal recessive deafness.","Variant counts

Summary
Olfactory receptors interact with odorant molecules in the nose, to initiate a neuronal response that triggers the perception of a smell. The olfactory receptor proteins are members of a large family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) arising from single coding-exon genes. Olfactory receptors share a 7-transmembrane domain structure with many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors and are responsible for the recognition and G protein-mediated transduction of odorant signals. The olfactory receptor gene family is the largest in the genome.

Summary
This gene encodes for a light absorbing visual pigment of the opsin gene family. The encoded protein is called red cone photopigment or long-wavelength sensitive opsin. Opsins are G-protein coupled receptors with seven transmembrane domains, an N-terminal extracellular domain, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. This gene and the medium-wavelength opsin gene are tandemly arrayed on the X chromosome and frequent unequal recombination and gene conversion may occur between these sequences. X chromosomes may have fusions of the medium- and long-wavelength opsin genes or may have more than one copy of these genes. Defects in this gene are the cause of partial, protanopic colorblindness.","Variant counts

Summary
Olfactory receptors interact with odorant molecules in the nose, to initiate a neuronal response that triggers the perception of a smell. The olfactory receptor proteins are members of a large family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) arising from single coding-exon genes. Olfactory receptors share a 7-transmembrane domain structure with many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors and are responsible for the recognition and G protein-mediated transduction of odorant signals. The olfactory receptor gene family is the largest in the genome. The nomenclature assigned to the olfactory receptor genes and proteins for this organism is independent of other organisms.","Variant counts
The variants found in rare patients tested by 3billion are classified and counted according to ACMG guidelines. The variants with over 5% variant frequency in population genome databases ( gnomAD, dbSNP, etc) are excluded.

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the bicoid sub-family of homeodomain-containing transcription factors. The encoded protein acts as a transcription factor and may play a role in brain and sensory organ development. A similar protein in mouse is required for proper brain and sensory organ development and can cause epilepsy. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the bicoid subfamily of homeodomain-containing transcription factors. The encoded protein acts as a transcription factor and plays a role in brain, craniofacial, and sensory organ development. The encoded protein also influences the proliferation and differentiation of dopaminergic neuronal progenitor cells during mitosis. Mutations in this gene cause syndromic microphthalmia 5 (MCOPS5) and combined pituitary hormone deficiency 6 (CPHD6). This gene is also suspected of having an oncogenic role in medulloblastoma. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms. Pseudogenes of this gene are known to exist on chromosomes two and nine.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a secreted glycoprotein with a C-terminal complement Cq1-like globular domain that belongs to the C1q/tumor necrosis factor-related protein (CTRP) family. The encoded protein is expressed in the inner ear and forms a multimeric complex called the otoconia, together with cerebellin-1 and otoconin-90, as part of the otoconial membrane. It contains extensive posttranslational modifications including hydroxylated prolines and glycosylated lysines. Naturally occurring mutations in this gene are associated with abnormal otoconia formation and balance deficits resulting from vestibular dysfunction.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a precursor protein that is processed to produce oxytocin and neurophysin I. Oxytocin is a posterior pituitary hormone which is synthesized as an inactive precursor in the hypothalamus along with its carrier protein neurophysin I. Together with neurophysin, it is packaged into neurosecretory vesicles and transported axonally to the nerve endings in the neurohypophysis, where it is either stored or secreted into the bloodstream. The precursor seems to be activated while it is being transported along the axon to the posterior pituitary. This hormone contracts smooth muscle during parturition and lactation. It is also involved in cognition, tolerance, adaptation and complex sexual and maternal behaviour, as well as in the regulation of water excretion and cardiovascular functions.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is located on the X chromosome and encodes a centrosomal protein. A knockout mouse model has been used to study the effect of mutations in this gene. The mouse gene is also located on the X chromosome, however, unlike the human gene it is not subject to X inactivation. Mutations in this gene are associated with oral-facial-digital syndrome type I and Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome type 2. Many pseudogenes have been identified; a single pseudogene is found on chromosome 5 while as many as fifteen have been found on the Y chromosome.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the 7 transmembrane-spanning G protein-coupled receptor family, and functions as a receptor for the endogenous, opioid-related neuropeptide, nociceptin/orphanin FQ. This receptor-ligand system modulates a variety of biological functions and neurobehavior, including stress responses and anxiety behavior, learning and memory, locomotor activity, and inflammatory and immune responses. A promoter region between this gene and the 5'-adjacent RGS19 (regulator of G-protein signaling 19) gene on the opposite strand functions bi-directionally as a core-promoter for both genes, suggesting co-operative transcriptional regulation of these two functionally related genes. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described for this gene. A recent study provided evidence for translational readthrough in this gene, and expression of an additional C-terminally extended isoform via the use of an alternative in-frame translation termination codon.","Variant counts

The olfactory receptor gene family is the largest in the genome. The nomenclature assigned to the olfactory receptor genes and proteins for this organism is independent of other organisms. This olfactory receptor gene is a segregating pseudogene, where some individuals have an allele that encodes a functional olfactory receptor, while other individuals have an allele encoding a protein that is predicted to be non-functional.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes for a light absorbing visual pigment of the opsin gene family. The encoded protein is called green cone photopigment or medium-wavelength sensitive opsin. Opsins are G-protein coupled receptors with seven transmembrane domains, an N-terminal extracellular domain, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. The long-wavelength opsin gene and multiple copies of the medium-wavelength opsin gene are tandemly arrayed on the X chromosome and frequent unequal recombination and gene conversion may occur between these sequences. X chromosomes may have fusions of the medium- and long-wavelength opsin genes or may have more than one copy of these genes. Defects in this gene are the cause of deutanopic colorblindness.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes the enzyme responsible for the excision of 8-oxoguanine, a mutagenic base byproduct which occurs as a result of exposure to reactive oxygen. The action of this enzyme includes lyase activity for chain cleavage. Alternative splicing of the C-terminal region of this gene classifies splice variants into two major groups, type 1 and type 2, depending on the last exon of the sequence. Type 1 alternative splice variants end with exon 7 and type 2 end with exon 8. All variants share the N-terminal region in common, which contains a mitochondrial targeting signal that is essential for mitochondrial localization. Many alternative splice variants for this gene have been described, but the full-length nature for every variant has not been determined.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the evolutionarily conserved ovo-like protein family. Mammalian members of this family contain a single zinc finger domain composed of a tetrad of C2H2 zinc fingers with variable N- and C-terminal extensions that contain intrinsically disordered domains. Members of this family are involved in epithelial development and differentiation. Knockout of this gene in mouse results in early embryonic lethality with phenotypes that include neurectoderm expansion, impaired vascularization, and heart anomalies. In humans, allelic variants of this gene have been associated with posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy.","Variant counts

Summary
Olfactory receptors interact with odorant molecules in the nose, to initiate a neuronal response that triggers the perception of a smell. The olfactory receptor proteins are members of a large family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) arising from single coding-exon genes. Olfactory receptors share a 7-transmembrane domain structure with many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors and are responsible for the recognition and G protein-mediated transduction of odorant signals. The olfactory receptor gene family is the largest in the genome. The nomenclature assigned to the olfactory receptor genes and proteins for this organism is independent of other organisms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes an oxidative stress response protein that regulates cell death. Expression of the gene is regulated by p53 and is induced by DNA damage. The protein regulates apoptosis by inducing cytochrome c release from mitochondria. It also appears to be a key regulator of both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory molecules. The loss of this protein correlates with uncontrolled cell growth and tumor formation. Naturally occurring read-through transcription exists between this gene and the neighboring upstream malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MLYCD) gene, but the read-through transcripts are unlikely to produce a protein product.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is similar to oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH) of the OGDH complex, which degrades glucose and glutamate. This gene encodes several isoforms, including some that appear to localize to mitochondria. The encoded protein down-regulates the AKT signaling cascade and can suppress the growth of cervical cancer cells.","Variant counts

The olfactory receptor proteins are members of a large family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) arising from single coding-exon genes. Olfactory receptors share a 7-transmembrane domain structure with many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors and are responsible for the recognition and G protein-mediated transduction of odorant signals. The olfactory receptor gene family is the largest in the genome. The nomenclature assigned to the olfactory receptor genes and proteins for this organism is independent of other organisms.","Variant counts
The variants found in rare patients tested by 3billion are classified and counted according to ACMG guidelines. The variants with over 5% variant frequency in population genome databases ( gnomAD, dbSNP, etc) are excluded.

Summary
This gene encodes a large, carbohydrate-rich, epithelial glycoprotein with numerous O-glycosylation sites located within threonine, serine, and proline-rich tandem repeats. The gene is similar to members of the mucin and the glycosyl hydrolase 18 gene families. Regulation of expression may be estrogen-dependent. Gene expression and protein secretion occur during late follicular development through early cleavage-stage embryonic development. The protein is secreted from non-ciliated oviductal epithelial cells and associates with ovulated oocytes, blastomeres, and spermatozoan acrosomal regions.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is induced by interferons and encodes a protein that synthesizes 2',5'-oligoadenylates (2-5As). This protein activates latent RNase L, which results in viral RNA degradation and the inhibition of viral replication. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants with different enzymatic activities. Polymorphisms in this gene have been associated with susceptibility to viral infection and diabetes mellitus, type 1. A disease-associated allele in a splice acceptor site influences the production of the p46 splice isoform. This gene is located in a cluster of related genes on chromosome 12.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the 2-5A synthetase family, essential proteins involved in the innate immune response to viral infection. The encoded protein is induced by interferons and uses adenosine triphosphate in 2'-specific nucleotidyl transfer reactions to synthesize 2',5'-oligoadenylates (2-5As). These molecules activate latent RNase L, which results in viral RNA degradation and the inhibition of viral replication. The three known members of this gene family are located in a cluster on chromosome 12. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described.","Variant counts

This protein is localized in the plasma membrane and may have an accessory role in opioid receptor function. This gene has an ortholog in rat and bovine. The opioid binding-cell adhesion molecule encoded by the rat gene binds opioid alkaloids in the presence of acidic lipids, exhibits selectivity for mu ligands and acts as a GPI-anchored protein. Since the encoded protein is highly conserved in species during evolution, it may have a fundamental role in mammalian systems. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, at least one of which encodes an isoform that is proteolytically processed.","Variant counts

Summary
Olfactory receptors interact with odorant molecules in the nose, to initiate a neuronal response that triggers the perception of a smell. The olfactory receptor proteins are members of a large family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) arising from single coding-exon genes. Olfactory receptors share a 7-transmembrane domain structure with many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors and are responsible for the recognition and G protein-mediated transduction of odorant signals. The olfactory receptor gene family is the largest in the genome. The nomenclature assigned to the olfactory receptor genes and proteins for this organism is independent of other organisms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a small extracellular protein belonging to the lipocalin superfamily. The protein is thought to transport small, hydrophobic, volatile molecules or odorants through the nasal mucus to olfactory receptors, and may also function as a scavenger of highly concentrated or toxic odors. The protein is expressed as a monomer in the nasal mucus, and can bind diverse types of odorants with a higher affinity for aldehydes and fatty acids. This gene and a highly similar family member are located in a cluster of lipocalin genes on chromosome 9. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described, but their biological validity has not been determined.","Variant counts

The origin recognition complex (ORC) is a highly conserved six subunit protein complex essential for the initiation of the DNA replication in eukaryotic cells. Studies in yeast demonstrated that ORC binds specifically to origins of replication and serves as a platform for the assembly of additional initiation factors such as Cdc6 and Mcm proteins. The protein encoded by this gene is a subunit of the ORC complex. Gene silencing studies with small interfering RNA demonstrated that this protein plays an essential role in coordinating chromosome replication and segregation with cytokinesis.","Variant counts

Studies in yeast demonstrated that ORC binds specifically to origins of replication and serves as a platform for the assembly of additional initiation factors such as Cdc6 and Mcm proteins. The protein encoded by this gene is the largest subunit of the ORC complex. While other ORC subunits are stable throughout the cell cycle, the levels of this protein vary during the cell cycle, which has been shown to be controlled by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis after initiation of DNA replication. This protein is found to be selectively phosphorylated during mitosis. It is also reported to interact with MYST histone acetyltransferase 2 (MyST2/HBO1), a protein involved in control of transcription silencing. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Opsins are members of the guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptor superfamily. This opsin gene is expressed in the eye, brain, testes, and spinal cord. This gene belongs to the seven-exon subfamily of mammalian opsin genes that includes peropsin (RRH) and retinal G protein coupled receptor (RGR). Like these other seven-exon opsin genes, this family member may encode a protein with photoisomerase activity. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
Opsins are members of the guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptor superfamily. This gene encodes a photoreceptive opsin protein that is expressed within the ganglion and amacrine cell layers of the retina. In mouse, retinal ganglion cell axons expressing this gene projected to the suprachiasmatic nucleus and other brain nuclei involved in circadian photoentrainment. In mouse, this protein is coupled to a transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channel through a G protein signaling pathway and produces a physiologic light response via membrane depolarization and increased intracellular calcium. The protein functions as a sensory photopigment and may also have photoisomerase activity. Experiments with knockout mice indicate that this gene attenuates, but does not abolish, photoentrainment. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
Olfactory receptors interact with odorant molecules in the nose, to initiate a neuronal response that triggers the perception of a smell. The olfactory receptor proteins are members of a large family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) arising from single coding-exon genes. Olfactory receptors share a 7-transmembrane domain structure with many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors and are responsible for the recognition and G protein-mediated transduction of odorant signals. The olfactory receptor gene family is the largest in the genome. The nomenclature assigned to the olfactory receptor genes and proteins for this organism is independent of other organisms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes an integral membrane protein that is required for cytokine-induced regulation of the tight junction paracellular permeability barrier. Mutations in this gene are thought to be a cause of band-like calcification with simplified gyration and polymicrogyria (BLC-PMG), an autosomal recessive neurologic disorder that is also known as pseudo-TORCH syndrome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. A related pseudogene is present 1.5 Mb downstream on the q arm of chromosome 5.","Variant counts

Summary
Olfactory receptors interact with odorant molecules in the nose, to initiate a neuronal response that triggers the perception of a smell. The olfactory receptor proteins are members of a large family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) arising from single coding-exon genes. Olfactory receptors share a 7-transmembrane domain structure with many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors and are responsible for the recognition and G protein-mediated transduction of odorant signals. The olfactory receptor gene family is the largest in the genome. The nomenclature assigned to the olfactory receptor genes and proteins for this organism is independent of other organisms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the OTU (ovarian tumor) domain-containing cysteine protease superfamily. The OTU domain confers deubiquitinase activity and the encoded protein has been shown to suppress the type I interferon-dependent innate immune response by cleaving the polyubiquitin chain from an essential type I interferon adaptor protein. Cleavage results in disassociation of the adaptor protein from a downstream signaling complex and disruption of the type I interferon signaling cascade. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described.","Variant counts

Olfactory receptors interact with odorant molecules in the nose, to initiate a neuronal response that triggers the perception of a smell. The olfactory receptor proteins are members of a large family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) arising from single coding-exon genes. Olfactory receptors share a 7-transmembrane domain structure with many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors and are responsible for the recognition and G protein-mediated transduction of odorant signals. The olfactory receptor gene family is the largest in the genome. The nomenclature assigned to the olfactory receptor genes and proteins for this organism is independent of other organisms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes one of at least three opioid receptors in humans; the mu opioid receptor (MOR). The MOR is the principal target of endogenous opioid peptides and opioid analgesic agents such as beta-endorphin and enkephalins. The MOR also has an important role in dependence to other drugs of abuse, such as nicotine, cocaine, and alcohol via its modulation of the dopamine system. The NM_001008503.2:c.118A>G allele has been associated with opioid and alcohol addiction and variations in pain sensitivity but evidence for it having a causal role is conflicting. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. Though the canonical MOR belongs to the superfamily of 7-transmembrane-spanning G-protein-coupled receptors some isoforms of this gene have only 6 transmembrane domains.","Variant counts

Summary
Mutations in this gene are a cause of neurosensory nonsyndromic recessive deafness, DFNB9. The short form of the encoded protein has 3 C2 domains, a single carboxy-terminal transmembrane domain found also in the C. elegans spermatogenesis factor FER-1 and human dysferlin, while the long form has 6 C2 domains. The homology suggests that this protein may be involved in vesicle membrane fusion. Several transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a component of the acellular membranes of the inner ear. Disruption of the orthologous mouse gene shows that it plays a role in auditory and vestibular functions. It is involved in fibrillar network organization, the anchoring of otoconial membranes and cupulae to the neuroepithelia, and likely in sound stimulation resistance. Mutations in this gene cause autosomal recessive nonsyndromic deafness, type 18B. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts
