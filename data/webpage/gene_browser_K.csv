Summary
This gene encodes a transmembrane protein that is preferentially expressed in the nervous system where it controls neuronal cell survival, differentiation into exons and dendrites, and synaptic plasticity. The encoded protein interacts with membrane receptors, cytosolic signaling components, and cytoskeletal proteins, serving as a scaffold that mediates crosstalk between the neurotrophin pathway and several other intracellular signaling pathways. Aberrant expression of this gene is associated with the onset of various neuropsychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Naturally occurring mutations in this gene are associated with a syndrome characterized by spastic paraplegia, intellectual disability, nystagmus and obesity. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Potassium channels represent the most complex class of voltage-gated ion channels from both functional and structural standpoints. Their diverse functions include regulating neurotransmitter release, heart rate, insulin secretion, neuronal excitability, epithelial electrolyte transport, smooth muscle contraction, and cell volume. Four sequence-related potassium channel genes - shaker, shaw, shab, and shal - have been identified in Drosophila, and each has been shown to have human homolog(s). This gene encodes a member of the potassium channel, voltage-gated, shaker-related subfamily. This member contains six membrane-spanning domains with a shaker-type repeat in the fourth segment. The gene is expressed preferentially in skeletal muscle, heart and kidney. It is a candidate gene for inherited cardiac disorders.","Variant counts

Potassium channels represent the most complex class of voltage-gated ino channels from both functional and structural standpoints. Their diverse functions include regulating neurotransmitter release, heart rate, insulin secretion, neuronal excitability, epithelial electrolyte transport, smooth muscle contraction, and cell volume. Four sequence-related potassium channel genes - shaker, shaw, shab, and shal - have been identified in Drosophila, and each has been shown to have human homolog(s). This gene encodes a member of the potassium channel, voltage-gated, shaker-related subfamily. This member contains six membrane-spanning domains with a shaker-type repeat in the fourth segment. It belongs to the delayed rectifier class, the function of which could restore the resting membrane potential of beta cells after depolarization and thereby contribute to the regulation of insulin secretion. This gene is intronless, and the gene is clustered with genes KCNA1 and KCNA6 on chromosome 12. Defects in this gene are a cause of familial atrial fibrillation type 7 (ATFB7).","Variant counts

Summary
Potassium channels represent the most complex class of voltage-gated ion channels from both functional and structural standpoints. Their diverse functions include regulating neurotransmitter release, heart rate, insulin secretion, neuronal excitability, epithelial electrolyte transport, smooth muscle contraction, and cell volume. Four sequence-related potassium channel genes - shaker, shaw, shab, and shal - have been identified in Drosophila, and each has been shown to have human homolog(s). This gene encodes a member of the potassium channel, voltage-gated, shaker-related subfamily. This member contains six membrane-spanning domains with a shaker-type repeat in the fourth segment. It belongs to the delayed rectifier class, members of which allow nerve cells to efficiently repolarize following an action potential. It plays an essential role in T-cell proliferation and activation. This gene appears to be intronless and it is clustered together with KCNA2 and KCNA10 genes on chromosome 1.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a voltage-gated delayed potassium channel that is phylogenetically related to the Drosophila Shaker channel. The encoded protein has six putative transmembrane segments (S1-S6), and the loop between S5 and S6 forms the pore and contains the conserved selectivity filter motif (GYGD). The functional channel is a homotetramer. The N-terminus of the channel is associated with beta subunits that can modify the inactivation properties of the channel as well as affect expression levels. The C-terminus of the channel is complexed to a PDZ domain protein that is responsible for channel targeting. Mutations in this gene have been associated with myokymia with periodic ataxia (AEMK).","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a component of the multiprotein assembly that is required for creation of kinetochore-microtubule attachments and chromosome segregation. The encoded protein functions as a scaffold for proteins that influence the spindle assembly checkpoint during the eukaryotic cell cycle and it interacts with at least five different kinetochore proteins and two checkpoint kinases. In adults, this gene is predominantly expressed in normal testes, various cancer cell lines and primary tumors from other tissues and is ubiquitously expressed in fetal tissues. This gene was originally identified as a fusion partner with the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) gene in t(11;15)(q23;q14). Mutations in this gene cause autosomal recessive primary microcephaly-4 (MCPH4). Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. Additional splice variants have been described but their biological validity has not been confirmed.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the KLHL (Kelch-like) family of proteins. This protein has been identified as an autoantigen in the autoimmune disease Sjogren's syndrome and as a potential biomarker in primary biliary cirrhosis. This protein may act as a substrate adaptor of the Cullin-3 ubiquitin ligase complex to promote substrate-specific ubiquitylation. Ubiquitylation by this complex has been shown to regulate the Wnt signaling pathway as well as COPII vesicle coat size. A pseudogene has been identified on chromosome 22. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that belongs to a conserved family of potassium channel tetramerization domain (KCTD)-containing proteins. The encoded protein functions in ciliogenesis by acting as a substrate adaptor for the cullin3-based ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E3 ligase, and targets trichoplein, a keratin-binding protein, for degradation via polyubiquitinylation. A mutation in this gene is associated with autosomal dominant myoclonic dystonia 26.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a protein containing four ankyrin repeats, a band 4.1/ezrin/radixin/moesin (FERM) domain, and multiple NPXY sequences. The encoded protein is localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm. It binds to integrin cytoplasmic domain-associated protein-1 alpha (ICAP1alpha), and plays a critical role in beta1-integrin-mediated cell proliferation. It associates with junction proteins and RAS-related protein 1A (Rap1A), which requires the encoded protein for maintaining the integrity of endothelial junctions. It is also a microtubule-associated protein and may play a role in microtubule targeting. Mutations in this gene result in cerebral cavernous malformations. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene was initially characterized in human as having high expression levels in breast carcinomas and breast cancer cell lines. This gene also has increased expression in prostrate cancer cells relative to normal prostrate tissues. Expression of this gene is negatively regulated by direct binding of the microRNA miR-195 to its 3' UTR. miR-195 has been shown to modulate the invasiveness of prostrate cancer cells and xenograft metastases by downgrading expression of this gene. In mouse, the protein encoded by this gene was identified as an antigen on acute monocytic leukemia cells. In human, alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms; some of these isoforms are predicted to contain an RNA pol II promoter FMP27 protein domain and a Golgi-body-localization APT1 domain.","Variant counts

Summary
Conventional kinesin is a tetrameric molecule composed of two heavy chains and two light chains, and transports various cargos along microtubules toward their plus ends. The heavy chains provide the motor activity, while the light chains bind to various cargos. This gene encodes a member of the kinesin light chain family. It associates with kinesin heavy chain through an N-terminal domain, and six tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs are thought to be involved in binding of cargos such as vesicles, mitochondria, and the Golgi complex. Thus, kinesin light chains function as adapter molecules and not motors per se. Although previously named 'kinesin 2', this gene is not a member of the kinesin-2 / kinesin heavy chain subfamily of kinesin motor proteins. Extensive alternative splicing produces isoforms with different C-termini that are proposed to bind to different cargos; however, the full-length nature and/or biological validity of most of these variants have not been determined.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a member of the kinesin light chain gene family. Kinesins are molecular motors involved in the transport of cargo along microtubules, and are composed of two kinesin heavy chain (KHC) and two kinesin light chain (KLC) molecules. KLCs are thought to typically be involved in binding cargo and regulating kinesin activity. In the rat, a protein similar to this gene product is expressed in post-meiotic spermatids, where it associates with structural components of sperm tails and mitochondria.","Variant counts

Summary
Potassium channels represent the most complex class of voltage-gated ion channels from both functional and structural standpoints. Their diverse functions include regulating neurotransmitter release, heart rate, insulin secretion, neuronal excitability, epithelial electrolyte transport, smooth muscle contraction, and cell volume. Four sequence-related potassium channel genes - shaker, shaw, shab, and shal - have been identified in Drosophila, and each has been shown to have human homolog(s). This gene encodes a member of the potassium channel, voltage-gated, shaker-related subfamily. This member contains six membrane-spanning domains with a shaker-type repeat in the fourth segment. It is specifically regulated by cGMP and postulated to mediate the effects of substances that increase intracellular cGMP. This gene is intronless, and the gene is clustered with genes KCNA2 and KCNA3 on chromosome 1.","Variant counts

Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels represent the most complex class of voltage-gated ion channels from both functional and structural standpoints. Their diverse functions include regulating neurotransmitter release, heart rate, insulin secretion, neuronal excitability, epithelial electrolyte transport, smooth muscle contraction, and cell volume. This gene encodes a member of the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily V. This member is identified as a 'silent subunit', and it does not form homomultimers, but forms heteromultimers with several other subfamily members. Through obligatory heteromerization, it exerts a function-altering effect on other potassium channel subunits. This protein is strongly expressed in pancreas and has a weaker expression in several other tissues.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the F-box protein family which is characterized by an approximately 40 amino acid motif, the F-box. The F-box proteins constitute one of the four subunits of ubiquitin protein ligase complex called SCFs (SKP1-cullin-F-box), which function in phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination. The F-box proteins are divided into 3 classes: Fbws containing WD-40 domains, Fbls containing leucine-rich repeats, and Fbxs containing either different protein-protein interaction modules or no recognizable motifs. The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the Fbls class and, in addition to an F-box, contains at least six highly degenerated leucine-rich repeats. This family member plays a role in epigenetic silencing. It nucleates at CpG islands and specifically demethylates both mono- and di-methylated lysine-36 of histone H3. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the grandular kallikrein protein family. Kallikreins are a subgroup of serine proteases that are clustered on chromosome 19. Members of this family are involved in a diverse array of biological functions. The protein encoded by this gene is a highly active trypsin-like serine protease that selectively cleaves at arginine residues. This protein is primarily expressed in prostatic tissue and is responsible for cleaving pro-prostate-specific antigen into its enzymatically active form. This gene is highly expressed in prostate tumor cells and may be a prognostic maker for prostate cancer risk. Alternate splicing results in both coding and non-coding transcript variants.","Variant counts

Kallikreins are a subgroup of serine proteases having diverse physiological functions. Growing evidence suggests that many kallikreins are implicated in carcinogenesis and some have potential as novel cancer and other disease biomarkers. The gene is one of the fifteen kallikrein subfamily members located in a cluster on chromosome 19. It encodes a single-chain glycoprotein, a protease which is synthesized in the epithelial cells of the prostate gland, and is present in seminal plasma. It is thought to function normally in the liquefaction of seminal coagulum, presumably by hydrolysis of the high molecular mass seminal vesicle protein. The serum level of this protein, called PSA in the clinical setting, is useful in the diagnosis and monitoring of prostatic carcinoma. Alternate splicing of this gene generates several transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate the mature protease. Expression of this protease is regulated by steroid hormones and may be elevated in multiple human cancers and in serum from psoriasis patients. The encoded protease may participate in the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein and alpha-synuclein, thus implicating this protease in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, respectively. This gene is located in a gene cluster on chromosome 19.

Summary
This gene is a metastasis suppressor gene that suppresses metastases of melanomas and breast carcinomas without affecting tumorigenicity. The encoded protein may inhibit chemotaxis and invasion and thereby attenuate metastasis in malignant melanomas. Studies suggest a putative role in the regulation of events downstream of cell-matrix adhesion, perhaps involving cytoskeletal reorganization. A protein product of this gene, kisspeptin, stimulates gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-induced gonadotropin secretion and regulates the pubertal activation of GnRH nuerons. A polymorphism in the terminal exon of this mRNA results in two protein isoforms. An adenosine present at the polymorphic site represents the third position in a stop codon. When the adenosine is absent, a downstream stop codon is utilized and the encoded protein extends for an additional seven amino acid residues.","Variant counts

Summary
The small G protein GDP dissociation stimulator (smg GDS) is a regulator protein having two activities on a group of small G proteins including the Rho and Rap1 family members and Ki-Ras; one is to stimulate their GDP/GTP exchange reactions, and the other is to inhibit their interactions with membranes. The protein encoded by this gene contains 9 'Armadillo' repeats and interacts with the smg GDS protein through these repeats. This protein, which is highly concentrated around the endoplasmic reticulum, is phosphorylated by v-src, and this phosphorylation reduces the affinity of the protein for smg GDS. It is thought that this protein serves as a linker between human chromosome-associated polypeptide (HCAP) and KIF3A/B, a kinesin superfamily protein in the nucleus, and that it plays a role in the interaction of chromosomes with an ATPase motor protein. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is part of a potentially heterotetrameric voltage-independent potassium channel that is activated by intracellular calcium. Activation is followed by membrane hyperpolarization, which promotes calcium influx. The encoded protein may be part of the predominant calcium-activated potassium channel in T-lymphocytes. This gene is similar to other KCNN family potassium channel genes, but it differs enough to possibly be considered as part of a new subfamily.","Variant counts

Summary
Action potentials in vertebrate neurons are followed by an afterhyperpolarization (AHP) that may persist for several seconds and may have profound consequences for the firing pattern of the neuron. Each component of the AHP is kinetically distinct and is mediated by different calcium-activated potassium channels. This gene belongs to the KCNN family of potassium channels. It encodes an integral membrane protein that forms a voltage-independent calcium-activated channel, which is thought to regulate neuronal excitability by contributing to the slow component of synaptic AHP. This gene contains two CAG repeat regions in the coding sequence. It was thought that expansion of one or both of these repeats could lead to an increased susceptibility to schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, but studies indicate that this is probably not the case. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Action potentials in vertebrate neurons are followed by an afterhyperpolarization (AHP) that may persist for several seconds and may have profound consequences for the firing pattern of the neuron. Each component of the AHP is kinetically distinct and is mediated by different calcium-activated potassium channels. The protein encoded by this gene is activated before membrane hyperpolarization and is thought to regulate neuronal excitability by contributing to the slow component of synaptic AHP. This gene is a member of the KCNN family of potassium channel genes. The encoded protein is an integral membrane protein that forms a voltage-independent calcium-activated channel with three other calmodulin-binding subunits. Alternate splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene, a Kirsten ras oncogene homolog from the mammalian ras gene family, encodes a protein that is a member of the small GTPase superfamily. A single amino acid substitution is responsible for an activating mutation.

Summary
This gene encodes a secreted member of the insulin growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP) superfamily. The protein contains an insulin growth factor-binding domain in its N-terminal region, a Kazal-type serine protease inhibitor and follistatin-like domain in its central region, and an immunoglobulin-like domain in its C-terminal region. Studies of the mouse ortholog suggest that this protein may function in bone development and bone regeneration. This gene is hypomethylated and over-expressed in high-grade glioma compared to low-grade glioma, and thus the hypomethylated gene may be associated with cell proliferation and the shorter survival of patients with high-grade glioma. It is also one of numerous genes found to be deleted in a novel 5.54 Mb interstitial deletion, which is associated with multiple congenital anomalies. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

The encoded protein is thought to control the G1-to-S transition of the cell cycle following DNA damage by mediating the tumor suppressor gene p53. Mice lacking this gene have a normal appearance but lose weight rapidly, and die shortly after birth due to fluid evaporation resulting from compromised epidermal barrier function. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of a family of molecular motors which are involved in intracellular transport of protein complexes, membrane organelles, and messenger ribonucleic acid along microtubules. Kinesins function as homodimeric molecules with two N-terminal head domains that move along microtubules and two C-terminal tail domains that interact with the transported cargo, either directly or indirectly, through adapter molecules. This gene is ubiquitously expressed in coronary arteries and other vascular tissue. A naturally occurring mutation in this gene is associated with coronary heart disease.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a cilia-associated protein belonging to the kinesin family. This protein plays a role in the sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway through the regulation of GLI transcription factors. It functions as a negative regulator of the SHH pathway by preventing inappropriate activation of GLI2 in the absence of ligand, and as a positive regulator by preventing the processing of GLI3 into its repressor form. Mutations in this gene have been associated with various ciliopathies.","Variant counts

Summary
Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes that can mediate lysis of certain tumor cells and virus-infected cells without previous activation. They can also regulate specific humoral and cell-mediated immunity. The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the killer cell lectin-like receptor (KLR) family, which is a group of transmembrane proteins preferentially expressed in NK cells. Studies in mice suggested that the expression of this gene may be regulated by MHC class I molecules.","Variant counts

Summary
Voltage-gated potassium channels form the largest and most diversified class of ion channels and are present in both excitable and nonexcitable cells. Their main functions are associated with the regulation of the resting membrane potential and the control of the shape and frequency of action potentials. The alpha subunits are of 2 types: those that are functional by themselves and those that are electrically silent but capable of modulating the activity of specific functional alpha subunits. The protein encoded by this gene is not functional by itself but can form heteromultimers with member 1 and with member 2 (and possibly other members) of the Shab-related subfamily of potassium voltage-gated channel proteins. This gene belongs to the S subfamily of the potassium channel family.","Variant counts

This gene is ubiquitously expressed and encodes a full-length protein which has an N-terminal BTB domain followed by a BACK domain and six kelch-like repeats in the C-terminus. These kelch-like repeats promote substrate ubiquitination of bound proteins via interaction of the BTB domain with the CUL3 (cullin 3) component of a cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL) complex. Muatations in this gene cause pseudohypoaldosteronism type IID (PHA2D); a rare Mendelian syndrome featuring hypertension, hyperkalaemia and metabolic acidosis. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
Potassium channels represent the most complex class of voltage-gated ion channels from both functional and structural standpoints. Their diverse functions include regulating neurotransmitter release, heart rate, insulin secretion, neuronal excitability, epithelial electrolyte transport, smooth muscle contraction, and cell volume. Four sequence-related potassium channel genes - shaker, shaw, shab, and shal - have been identified in Drosophila, and each has been shown to have human homolog(s). This gene encodes a member of the potassium channel, voltage-gated, shaker-related subfamily. This member contains six membrane-spanning domains with a shaker-type repeat in the fourth segment. It belongs to the delayed rectifier class. The coding region of this gene is intronless, and the gene is clustered with genes KCNA1 and KCNA5 on chromosome 12.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the TWIK-related arachidonic acid-stimulated two pore potassium channel subfamily. The encoded protein homodimerizes and functions as an outwardly rectifying channel. This channel is regulated by polyunsaturated fatty acids, temperature and mechanical deformation of the lipid membrane. This protein is expressed primarily in neural tissues and may be involved in regulating the noxious input threshold in dorsal root ganglia neurons. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Naturally occurring read-through transcripts also exist between this gene and the downstream testis expressed 40 (TEX40) gene, as represented in GeneID: 106780802.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the type II keratin family clustered on the long arm of chromosome 12. Type I and type II keratins heteropolymerize to form intermediate-sized filaments in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells. The product of this gene typically dimerizes with keratin 18 to form an intermediate filament in simple single-layered epithelial cells. This protein plays a role in maintaining cellular structural integrity and also functions in signal transduction and cellular differentiation. Mutations in this gene cause cryptogenic cirrhosis. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) are transmembrane glycoproteins expressed by natural killer cells and subsets of T cells. The KIR genes are polymorphic and highly homologous and they are found in a cluster on chromosome 19q13.4 within the 1 Mb leukocyte receptor complex (LRC). The gene content of the KIR gene cluster varies among haplotypes, although several 'framework' genes are found in all haplotypes (KIR3DL3, KIR3DP1, KIR3DL4, KIR3DL2). The KIR proteins are classified by the number of extracellular immunoglobulin domains (2D or 3D) and by whether they have a long (L) or short (S) cytoplasmic domain. KIR proteins with the long cytoplasmic domain transduce inhibitory signals upon ligand binding via an immune tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), while KIR proteins with the short cytoplasmic domain lack the ITIM motif and instead associate with the TYRO protein tyrosine kinase binding protein to transduce activating signals. The ligands for several KIR proteins are subsets of HLA class I molecules; thus, KIR proteins are thought to play an important role in regulation of the immune response.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the keratin gene family. The keratins are intermediate filament proteins responsible for the structural integrity of epithelial cells and are subdivided into cytokeratins and hair keratins. Most of the type I cytokeratins consist of acidic proteins which are arranged in pairs of heterotypic keratin chains and are clustered in a region of chromosome 17q12-q21. This keratin has been coexpressed with keratin 14 in a number of epithelial tissues, including esophagus, tongue, and hair follicles. Mutations in this gene are associated with type 1 pachyonychia congenita, non-epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma and unilateral palmoplantar verrucous nevus.","Variant counts

Summary
Nucleocytoplasmic transport, a signal- and energy-dependent process, takes place through nuclear pore complexes embedded in the nuclear envelope. The import of proteins containing a nuclear localization signal (NLS) requires the NLS import receptor, a heterodimer of importin alpha and beta subunits also known as karyopherins. Importin alpha binds the NLS-containing cargo in the cytoplasm and importin beta docks the complex at the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear pore complex. In the presence of nucleoside triphosphates and the small GTP binding protein Ran, the complex moves into the nuclear pore complex and the importin subunits dissociate. Importin alpha enters the nucleoplasm with its passenger protein and importin beta remains at the pore. The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the importin alpha family.","Variant counts

Summary
The import of proteins into the nucleus is a process that involves at least 2 steps. The first is an energy-independent docking of the protein to the nuclear envelope and the second is an energy-dependent translocation through the nuclear pore complex. Imported proteins require a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) which generally consists of a short region of basic amino acids or 2 such regions spaced about 10 amino acids apart. Proteins involved in the first step of nuclear import have been identified in different systems. These include the Xenopus protein importin and its yeast homolog, SRP1 (a suppressor of certain temperature-sensitive mutations of RNA polymerase I in Saccharomyces cerevisiae), which bind to the NLS. KPNA2 protein interacts with the NLSs of DNA helicase Q1 and SV40 T antigen and may be involved in the nuclear transport of proteins. KPNA2 also may play a role in V(D)J recombination. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
Potassium channels are present in most mammalian cells, where they participate in a wide range of physiologic responses. The protein encoded by this gene is an integral membrane protein and inward-rectifier type potassium channel. The encoded protein, which has a greater tendency to allow potassium to flow into a cell rather than out of a cell, is controlled by G-proteins and is found associated with the sulfonylurea receptor SUR. Mutations in this gene are a cause of familial persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (PHHI), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by unregulated insulin secretion. Defects in this gene may also contribute to autosomal dominant non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus type II (NIDDM), transient neonatal diabetes mellitus type 3 (TNDM3), and permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM). Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants that encode different protein isoforms have been described for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes that mediate cytotoxicity and secrete cytokines after immune stimulation. Several genes of the C-type lectin superfamily, including the rodent NKRP1 family of glycoproteins, are expressed by NK cells and may be involved in the regulation of NK cell function. The KLRB1 protein contains an extracellular domain with several motifs characteristic of C-type lectins, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain. The KLRB1 protein is classified as a type II membrane protein because it has an external C terminus.","Variant counts

Summary
Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) are transmembrane glycoproteins expressed by natural killer cells and subsets of T cells. The KIR genes are polymorphic and highly homologous and they are found in a cluster on chromosome 19q13.4 within the 1 Mb leukocyte receptor complex (LRC). The gene content of the KIR gene cluster varies among haplotypes, although several 'framework' genes are found in all haplotypes (KIR3DL3, KIR3DP1, KIR3DL4, KIR3DL2). The KIR proteins are classified by the number of extracellular immunoglobulin domains (2D or 3D) and by whether they have a long (L) or short (S) cytoplasmic domain. KIR proteins with the long cytoplasmic domain transduce inhibitory signals upon ligand binding via an immune tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), while KIR proteins with the short cytoplasmic domain lack the ITIM motif and instead associate with the TYRO protein tyrosine kinase binding protein to transduce activating signals. The ligands for several KIR proteins are subsets of HLA class I molecules; thus, KIR proteins are thought to play an important role in regulation of the immune response.","Variant counts

Summary
Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels represent the most complex class of voltage-gated ion channels from both functional and structural standpoints. Their diverse functions include regulating neurotransmitter release, heart rate, insulin secretion, neuronal excitability, epithelial electrolyte transport, smooth muscle contraction, and cell volume. This gene encodes a member of the potassium channel, voltage-gated, subfamily H. This member is a pore-forming (alpha) subunit of a voltage-gated non-inactivating delayed rectifier potassium channel. It is activated at the onset of myoblast differentiation. The gene is highly expressed in brain and in myoblasts. Overexpression of the gene may confer a growth advantage to cancer cells and favor tumor cell proliferation. Alternative splicing of this gene results in two transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.","Variant counts
The variants found in rare patients tested by 3billion are classified and counted according to ACMG guidelines. The variants with over 5% variant frequency in population genome databases ( gnomAD, dbSNP, etc) are excluded.

The encoded protein negatively regulates the AP-2 family of transcription factors and the Wnt signaling pathway. A mechanism for the modulation of Wnt signaling has been proposed in which the encoded protein enhances ubiquitination and degradation of the beta-catenin protein. Mutations in this gene have been identified in Scalp-ear-nipple (SEN) syndrome.","Variant counts

Summary
Potassium channels represent the most complex class of voltage-gated ion channels from both functional and structural standpoints. Their diverse functions include regulating neurotransmitter release, heart rate, insulin secretion, neuronal excitability, epithelial electrolyte transport, smooth muscle contraction, and cell volume. This gene encodes a potassium channel containing two pore-forming domains. This protein is an open channel that can be stimulated by arachidonic acid and inhibited by the anesthetic halothane.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the family of potassium channel proteins containing two pore-forming P domains. This channel is an open rectifier which primarily passes outward current under physiological K+ concentrations, and is stimulated strongly by arachidonic acid and to a lesser degree by membrane stretching, intracellular acidification, and general anaesthetics. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a ubiquitin ligase substrate receptor and is regulated by autoubiquitination. Variations in the translation initiation codon of this gene have been found, which result in an N-terminally truncated but more stable protein due to loss of the autoubiquitination function. The more stable mutant protein causes an increased ubiquitin and degradation of keratin 14, which leads to skin fragility and the potentially life-threatening disease epidermolysis bullosa. The encoded protein is also involved in the regulation of kainate receptors.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the kinesin-3 superfamily of microtubule motor proteins. These proteins are involved in numerous processes including vesicle transport, chromosome segregation, mitotic spindle formation, and cytokinesis. In human HeLa-S3 and 293T cells, this protein is localized to the cytoplasm during interphase, to the spindle poles and spindle microtubules during mitosis, and to the midbody during cytokinesis. An internal motor domain displays microtubule-dependent ATPase activity, consistent with its function as a microtubule motor protein. Knockdown of this gene results in failed cytokinesis with endoreplication, which results in multinucleated cells. This gene has been identified as a likely oncogene in breast, lung and ovarian cancers, as well as retinoblastomas and gliomas. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the kinesin superfamily of microtubule-associated molecular motors with functions related to the microtubule cytosekelton. Members of this superfamily play important roles in intracellular transport and cell division. A similar protein in mouse functions in the beta cell antioxidant signaling cascade, acting as a scaffold for the transcription factor specificity protein 1 (Sp1). Mice that lack this gene exhibit beta cell oxidative stress resulting in hypoinsulinemic glucose intolerance.","Variant counts

CBP and p300 are large nuclear proteins that bind to many sequence-specific factors involved in cell growth and/or differentiation, including c-jun and the adenoviral oncoprotein E1A. The protein encoded by this gene associates with p300/CBP. It has in vitro and in vivo binding activity with CBP and p300, and competes with E1A for binding sites in p300/CBP. It has histone acetyl transferase activity with core histones and nucleosome core particles, indicating that this protein plays a direct role in transcriptional regulation.","Variant counts

Summary
This protein is a member of the keratin-associated protein (KAP) family. The KAP proteins form a matrix of keratin intermediate filaments which contribute to the structure of hair fibers. KAP family members appear to have unique, family-specific amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions and are subdivided into three multi-gene families according to amino acid composition: the high sulfur, the ultrahigh sulfur, and the high tyrosine/glycine KAPs. This protein is a member of the ultrahigh sulfur KAP family and the gene is localized to a cluster of KAPs at 17q12-q21.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a member of the potassium channel family of proteins. The encoded voltage-gated ion channel allows the outward flow of potassium ions during plasma membrane hyperpolarization in sperm. Opening of this channel may be regulated by calcium ion levels. Homozygous knockout mice that lack the related mouse gene exhibit male sterility. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the Jumonji, AT-rich interactive domain 1 (JARID1) histone demethylase protein family. The encoded protein plays a role in gene regulation through the histone code by specifically demethylating lysine 4 of histone H3. The encoded protein interacts with many other proteins, including retinoblastoma protein, and is implicated in the transcriptional regulation of Hox genes and cytokines. This gene may play a role in tumor progression.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a lysine-specific histone demethylase that belongs to the jumonji/ARID domain-containing family of histone demethylases. The encoded protein is capable of demethylating tri-, di- and monomethylated lysine 4 of histone H3. This protein plays a role in the transcriptional repression or certain tumor suppressor genes and is upregulated in certain cancer cells. This protein may also play a role in genome stability and DNA repair. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is part of the multimeric HBO1 complex, which possesses histone H4-specific acetyltransferase activity. This activity is required for functional replication origins and is involved in transcriptional activation of some genes. In both cases, the acetylation of histone H4 helps unfold chromatin so that the DNA can be accessed and replicated or transcribed.","Variant counts

Summary
Microtubules, polymers of alpha and beta tubulin subunits, form the mitotic spindle of a dividing cell and help to organize membranous organelles during interphase. Katanin is a heterodimer that consists of a 60 kDa ATPase (p60 subunit A 1) and an 80 kDa accessory protein (p80 subunit B 1). The p60 subunit acts to sever and disassemble microtubules, while the p80 subunit targets the enzyme to the centrosome. This gene encodes the p80 subunit. This protein is a member of the AAA family of ATPases. Multiple alternatively spliced variants, encoding the same protein, have been identified.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene is a lysine-specific demethylase that specifically demethylates di- or tri-methylated lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me2 or H3K27me3). H3K27 trimethylation is a repressive epigenetic mark controlling chromatin organization and gene silencing. This protein can also demethylate non-histone proteins such as retinoblastoma protein. Through its demethylation actvity this gene influences cellular differentiation and development, tumorigenesis, inflammatory diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases. This protein has two classical nuclear localization signals at its N-terminus. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein which contains multiple domains including a CXXC zinc finger, three PHD zinc fingers, two FY-rich domains, and a SET (suppressor of variegation, enhancer of zeste, and trithorax) domain. The SET domain is a conserved C-terminal domain that characterizes proteins of the MLL (mixed-lineage leukemia) family. This gene is ubiquitously expressed in adult tissues. It is also amplified in solid tumor cell lines, and may be involved in human cancer. Two alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been reported for this gene, however, the full length nature of the shorter transcript is not known.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a transcriptional coactivator that plays an essential role in regulating gene expression during early development and hematopoiesis. The encoded protein contains multiple conserved functional domains. One of these domains, the SET domain, is responsible for its histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase activity which mediates chromatin modifications associated with epigenetic transcriptional activation. This protein is processed by the enzyme Taspase 1 into two fragments, MLL-C and MLL-N. These fragments reassociate and further assemble into different multiprotein complexes that regulate the transcription of specific target genes, including many of the HOX genes. Multiple chromosomal translocations involving this gene are the cause of certain acute lymphoid leukemias and acute myeloid leukemias. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
Potassium channels are present in most mammalian cells, where they participate in a wide range of physiologic responses. The protein encoded by this gene is an integral membrane protein and inward-rectifier type potassium channel. The encoded protein, which has a greater tendency to allow potassium to flow into a cell rather than out of a cell, is controlled by G-proteins and plays an important role in regulating heartbeat. It associates with three other G-protein-activated potassium channels to form a heteromultimeric pore-forming complex that also couples to neurotransmitter receptors in the brain and whereby channel activation can inhibit action potential firing by hyperpolarizing the plasma membrane. These multimeric G-protein-gated inwardly-rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels may play a role in the pathophysiology of epilepsy, addiction, Down's syndrome, ataxia, and Parkinson's disease. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct proteins.","Variant counts

Summary
Several different potassium channels are known to be involved with electrical signaling in the nervous system. One class is activated by depolarization whereas a second class is not. The latter are referred to as inwardly rectifying K+ channels, and they have a greater tendency to allow potassium to flow into the cell rather than out of it. This asymmetry in potassium ion conductance plays a key role in the excitability of muscle cells and neurons. The protein encoded by this gene is an integral membrane protein and member of the inward rectifier potassium channel family. The encoded protein has a small unitary conductance compared to other members of this protein family. Two transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Potassium channels are present in most mammalian cells, where they participate in a wide range of physiologic responses. The protein encoded by this gene is an integral membrane protein and inward-rectifier type potassium channel. The encoded protein, which has a greater tendency to allow potassium to flow into a cell rather than out of a cell, is controlled by G-proteins. Defects in this gene may be a cause of J-wave syndromes and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).","Variant counts

Summary
Activator protein-2 alpha (AP-2 alpha) is a developmentally-regulated transcription factor and important regulator of gene expression during vertebrate development and carcinogenesis. The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the Kruppel-like zinc finger protein family and can repress expression of the AP-2 alpha gene by binding to a specific site in the AP-2 alpha gene promoter. Repression by the encoded protein requires binding with a corepressor, CtBP1. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Nucleocytoplasmic transport, a signal- and energy-dependent process, takes place through nuclear pore complexes embedded in the nuclear envelope. The import of proteins containing a nuclear localization signal (NLS) requires the NLS import receptor, a heterodimer of importin alpha and beta subunits also known as karyopherins. Importin alpha binds the NLS-containing cargo in the cytoplasm and importin beta docks the complex at the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear pore complex. In the presence of nucleoside triphosphates and the small GTP binding protein Ran, the complex moves into the nuclear pore complex and the importin subunits dissociate. Importin alpha enters the nucleoplasm with its passenger protein and importin beta remains at the pore. Interactions between importin beta and the FG repeats of nucleoporins are essential in translocation through the pore complex. The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the importin beta family. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a high-affinity dickkopf homolog 1 (DKK1) transmembrane receptor. A similar protein in mouse functions interacts with with DKK1 to block wingless (WNT)/beta-catenin signaling. The encoded protein forms a ternary membrane complex with DKK1 and the WNT receptor lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6), and induces rapid endocytosis and removal of LRP6 from the plasma membrane. It contains extracellular kringle, WSC, and CUB domains. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been observed for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes that can mediate lysis of certain tumor cells and virus-infected cells without previous activation. They can also regulate specific humoral and cell-mediated immunity. NK cells preferentially express several calcium-dependent (C-type) lectins, which have been implicated in the regulation of NK cell function. The NKG2 gene family is located within the NK complex, a region that contains several C-type lectin genes preferentially expressed in NK cells. This gene encodes a member of the NKG2 family. The encoded transmembrane protein is characterized by a type II membrane orientation (has an extracellular C terminus) and the presence of a C-type lectin domain. It binds to a diverse family of ligands that include MHC class I chain-related A and B proteins and UL-16 binding proteins, where ligand-receptor interactions can result in the activation of NK and T cells. The surface expression of these ligands is important for the recognition of stressed cells by the immune system, and thus this protein and its ligands are therapeutic targets for the treatment of immune diseases and cancers. Read-through transcription exists between this gene and the upstream KLRC4 (killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily C, member 4) family member in the same cluster.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes the ligand of the tyrosine-kinase receptor encoded by the KIT locus. This ligand is a pleiotropic factor that acts in utero in germ cell and neural cell development, and hematopoiesis, all believed to reflect a role in cell migration. In adults, it functions pleiotropically, while mostly noted for its continued requirement in hematopoiesis. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene uses alternative splicing to generate two different proteins- high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK) and low molecular weight kininogen (LMWK). HMWK is essential for blood coagulation and assembly of the kallikrein-kinin system. Also, bradykinin, a peptide causing numerous physiological effects, is released from HMWK. Bradykinin also functions as an antimicrobial peptide with antibacterial and antifungal activity. In contrast to HMWK, LMWK is not involved in blood coagulation. Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reduces or depletes angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which results in an increase in levels of des-Arg(9)-bradykinin, a bioactive metabolite of bradykinin that is associated with lung injury and inflammation. Three transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 interacts with NF-E2-related factor 2 in a redox-sensitive manner and the dissociation of the proteins in the cytoplasm is followed by transportation of NF-E2-related factor 2 to the nucleus. This interaction results in the expression of the catalytic subunit of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase. Two alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same isoform have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Retention of resident soluble proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is achieved in both yeast and animal cells by their continual retrieval from the cis-Golgi, or a pre-Golgi compartment. Sorting of these proteins is dependent on a C-terminal tetrapeptide signal, usually lys-asp-glu-leu (KDEL) in animal cells, and his-asp-glu-leu (HDEL) in S. cerevisiae. This process is mediated by a receptor that recognizes, and binds the tetrapeptide-containing protein, and returns it to the ER. In yeast, the sorting receptor encoded by a single gene, ERD2, is a seven-transmembrane protein. Unlike yeast, several human homologs of the ERD2 gene, constituting the KDEL receptor gene family, have been described. KDELR2 was the second member of the family to be identified, and it encodes a protein which is 83% identical to the KDELR1 gene product. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes that can mediate lysis of certain tumor cells and virus-infected cells without previous activation. They can also regulate specific humoral and cell-mediated immunity. NK cells preferentially express several calcium-dependent (C-type) lectins, which have been implicated in the regulation of NK cell function. The group, designated KLRC (NKG2) are expressed primarily in natural killer (NK) cells and encodes a family of transmembrane proteins characterized by a type II membrane orientation (extracellular C terminus) and the presence of a C-type lectin domain. The KLRC (NKG2) gene family is located within the NK complex, a region that contains several C-type lectin genes preferentially expressed on NK cells. KLRC2 alternative splice variants have been described but their full-length nature has not been determined.","Variant counts

The gene belongs to a family of genes encoding proteins containing a BTB domain and several kelch repeats. The BTB domain functions as a protein-protein interaction module, which includes an ability to self-associate or to interact with non-BTB domain-containing proteins. The kelch motif typically occurs in groups of five to seven repeats, and has been found in proteins with diverse functions. Known functions of these family members include transcription regulation, ion channel tetramerization and gating, protein ubiquitination or degradation, and cytoskeleton regulation. The exact function of this family member has yet to be determined.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase. This gene was initially identified as a homolog of the feline sarcoma viral oncogene v-kit and is often referred to as proto-oncogene c-Kit. The canonical form of this glycosylated transmembrane protein has an N-terminal extracellular region with five immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane region, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain at the C-terminus. Upon activation by its cytokine ligand, stem cell factor (SCF), this protein phosphorylates multiple intracellular proteins that play a role in in the proliferation, differentiation, migration and apoptosis of many cell types and thereby plays an important role in hematopoiesis, stem cell maintenance, gametogenesis, melanogenesis, and in mast cell development, migration and function. This protein can be a membrane-bound or soluble protein. Mutations in this gene are associated with gastrointestinal stromal tumors, mast cell disease, acute myelogenous leukemia, and piebaldism. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a nuclear protein that forms intranuclear foci during proliferation and is redistributed in the nucleoplasm during the cell cycle. Short-wave ultraviolet light provokes the relocalization of the protein, suggesting its participation in the cellular response to DNA damage. Originally selected based on protein-binding with RecA antibodies, the mouse protein presents a limited similarity with a functional domain of the bacterial RecA protein, a characteristic shared by this human ortholog. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Four sequence-related potassium channel genes - shaker, shaw, shab, and shal - have been identified in Drosophila, and each has been shown to have human homolog(s). This gene encodes a member of the potassium channel, voltage-gated, shaker-related subfamily. This member includes distinct isoforms which are encoded by alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene. Some of these isoforms are beta subunits, which form heteromultimeric complexes with alpha subunits and modulate the activity of the pore-forming alpha subunits.","Variant counts

This gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 4 in a region that is associated with susceptibility to celiac disease. The encoded protein is similar to a Chinese hamster protein that is associated with spermatocyte and adipocyte differentiation. The C-terminus of the protein is also similar to a Caenorhabditis elegans protein that plays a role in lipid storage. In mammals, this protein is thought to function in the regulation of epithelial growth and differentiation, and in tumor development.","Variant counts

Summary
Potassium channels represent the most complex class of voltage-gated ion channels from both functional and structural standpoints. Their diverse functions include regulating neurotransmitter release, heart rate, insulin secretion, neuronal excitability, epithelial electrolyte transport, smooth muscle contraction, and cell volume. This gene encodes a sodium-activated potassium channel subunit which is thought to function in ion conductance and developmental signaling pathways. Mutations in this gene cause the early-onset epileptic disorders, malignant migrating partial seizures of infancy and autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Four sequence-related potassium channel genes - shaker, shaw, shab, and shal - have been identified in Drosophila, and each has been shown to have human homolog(s). This gene encodes a member of the potassium channel, voltage-gated, shal-related subfamily, members of which form voltage-activated A-type potassium ion channels and are prominent in the repolarization phase of the action potential.

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a histone acetyltransferase and component of the MOZ/MORF protein complex. In addition to its acetyltransferase activity, the encoded protein has transcriptional activation activity in its N-terminal end and transcriptional repression activity in its C-terminal end. This protein is necessary for RUNX2-dependent transcriptional activation and could be involved in brain development. Mutations have been found in patients with genitopatellar syndrome. A translocation of this gene and the CREBBP gene results in acute myeloid leukemias. Three transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the MOZ, YBFR2, SAS2, TIP60 family of histone acetyltransferases. The protein is composed of a nuclear localization domain, a double C2H2 zinc finger domain that binds to acetylated histone tails, a histone acetyl-transferase domain, a glutamate/aspartate-rich region, and a serine- and methionine-rich transactivation domain. It is part of a complex that acetylates lysine-9 residues in histone 3, and in addition, it acts as a co-activator for several transcription factors. Allelic variants of this gene are associated with an autosomal dominant form of cognitive disability. Chromosomal translocations of this gene are associated with acute myeloid leukemia. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the Jumonji domain 2 (JMJD2) family. The encoded protein is a trimethylation-specific demethylase, and converts specific trimethylated histone residues to the dimethylated form. This enzymatic action regulates gene expression and chromosome segregation. Chromosomal aberrations and changes in expression of this gene may be found in tumor cells. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
Keratins are intermediate filament proteins responsible for the structural integrity of epithelial cells and are subdivided into epithelial keratins and hair keratins. This gene's expression profile shows that it encodes a type II epithelial keratin, although structurally the encoded protein is more like a type II hair keratin. This protein is involved in cell differentiation, localizing near desmosomal plaques in earlier stages of differentiation but then dispersing throughout the cytoplasm in terminally differentiating cells. The type II keratins are clustered in a region of chromosome 12q13. Two transcript variants encoding two different fully functional isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the keratin gene family. As a type II hair keratin, it is a basic protein which heterodimerizes with type I keratins to form hair and nails. The type II hair keratins are clustered in a region of chromosome 12q13 and are grouped into two distinct subfamilies based on structure similarity. One subfamily, consisting of KRTHB1, KRTHB3, and KRTHB6, is highly related. The other less-related subfamily includes KRTHB2, KRTHB4, and KRTHB5. All hair keratins are expressed in the hair follicle; this hair keratin, as well as KRTHB3 and KRTHB6, is found primarily in the hair cortex. Mutations in this gene and KRTHB6 have been observed in patients with a rare dominant hair disease, monilethrix.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene forms a potassium channel that is thought to play a critical role in the regulation of neuronal excitability, particularly in sensory cells of the cochlea. The current generated by this channel is inhibited by M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and activated by retigabine, a novel anti-convulsant drug. The encoded protein can form a homomultimeric potassium channel or possibly a heteromultimeric channel in association with the protein encoded by the KCNQ3 gene. Defects in this gene are a cause of nonsyndromic sensorineural deafness type 2 (DFNA2), an autosomal dominant form of progressive hearing loss. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the KCNQ potassium channel gene family that is differentially expressed in subregions of the brain and in skeletal muscle. The protein encoded by this gene yields currents that activate slowly with depolarization and can form heteromeric channels with the protein encoded by the KCNQ3 gene. Currents expressed from this protein have voltage dependences and inhibitor sensitivities in common with M-currents. They are also inhibited by M1 muscarinic receptor activation. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The M channel is a slowly activating and deactivating potassium channel that plays a critical role in the regulation of neuronal excitability. The M channel is formed by the association of the protein encoded by this gene and a related protein encoded by the KCNQ3 gene, both integral membrane proteins. M channel currents are inhibited by M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and activated by retigabine, a novel anti-convulsant drug. Defects in this gene are a cause of benign familial neonatal convulsions type 1 (BFNC), also known as epilepsy, benign neonatal type 1 (EBN1). At least five transcript variants encoding five different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts
The variants found in rare patients tested by 3billion are classified and counted according to ACMG guidelines. The variants with over 5% variant frequency in population genome databases ( gnomAD, dbSNP, etc) are excluded.

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that functions in the regulation of neuronal excitability. The encoded protein forms an M-channel by associating with the products of the related KCNQ2 or KCNQ5 genes, which both encode integral membrane proteins. M-channel currents are inhibited by M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and are activated by retigabine, a novel anti-convulsant drug. Defects in this gene are a cause of benign familial neonatal convulsions type 2 (BFNC2), also known as epilepsy, benign neonatal type 2 (EBN2). Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel required for repolarization phase of the cardiac action potential. This protein can form heteromultimers with two other potassium channel proteins, KCNE1 and KCNE3. Mutations in this gene are associated with hereditary long QT syndrome 1 (also known as Romano-Ward syndrome), Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome, and familial atrial fibrillation. This gene exhibits tissue-specific imprinting, with preferential expression from the maternal allele in some tissues, and biallelic expression in others. This gene is located in a region of chromosome 11 amongst other imprinted genes that are associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), and itself has been shown to be disrupted by chromosomal rearrangements in patients with BWS. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) are transmembrane glycoproteins expressed by natural killer cells and subsets of T cells. The KIR genes are polymorphic and highly homologous and they are found in a cluster on chromosome 19q13.4 within the 1 Mb leukocyte receptor complex (LRC). The gene content of the KIR gene cluster varies among haplotypes, although several 'framework' genes are found in all haplotypes (KIR3DL3, KIR3DP1, KIR3DL4, KIR3DL2). The KIR proteins are classified by the number of extracellular immunoglobulin domains (2D or 3D) and by whether they have a long (L) or short (S) cytoplasmic domain. KIR proteins with the long cytoplasmic domain transduce inhibitory signals upon ligand binding via an immune tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), while KIR proteins with the short cytoplasmic domain lack the ITIM motif and instead associate with the TYRO protein tyrosine kinase binding protein to transduce activating signals. The ligands for several KIR proteins are subsets of HLA class I molecules; thus, KIR proteins are thought to play an important role in regulation of the immune response.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the kinesin family of microtubule-based motor proteins that function in the positioning of endosomes. This family member can direct mannose-6-phosphate receptor-containing vesicles from the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane, and it is necessary for the steady-state distribution of late endosomes/lysosomes. It is also required for the translocation of FYVE-CENT and TTC19 from the centrosome to the midbody during cytokinesis, and it plays a role in melanosome maturation. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Reduced production of this protein has been observed in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF), and this may be one of the factors underlying the degenerative processes (e.g., arteriosclerosis, osteoporosis, and skin atrophy) seen in CRF. Also, mutations within this protein have been associated with ageing and bone loss.","Variant counts
