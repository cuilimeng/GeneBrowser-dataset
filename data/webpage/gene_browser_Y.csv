Summary
This gene encodes a highly conserved cold shock domain protein that has broad nucleic acid binding properties. The encoded protein functions as both a DNA and RNA binding protein and has been implicated in numerous cellular processes including regulation of transcription and translation, pre-mRNA splicing, DNA reparation and mRNA packaging. This protein is also a component of messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes and may have a role in microRNA processing. This protein can be secreted through non-classical pathways and functions as an extracellular mitogen. Aberrant expression of the gene is associated with cancer proliferation in numerous tissues. This gene may be a prognostic marker for poor outcome and drug resistance in certain cancers. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Pseudogenes of this gene are found on multiple chromosomes.","Variant counts

YY1 may direct histone deacetylases and histone acetyltransferases to a promoter in order to activate or repress the promoter, thus implicating histone modification in the function of YY1.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a transcription factor that includes several Kruppel-like zinc fingers in its C-terminal region. It possesses both activation and repression domains, and it can therefore have both positive and negative effects on the transcription of target genes. This gene has an intronless coding region, and it appears to have arisen by retrotransposition of the related YY1 transcription factor gene, which is located on chromosome 14.","Variant counts

This gene product belongs to the 14-3-3 family of proteins which mediate signal transduction by binding to phosphoserine-containing proteins. This highly conserved protein family is found in both plants and mammals, and this protein is 99% identical to the mouse, rat and sheep orthologs. The encoded protein interacts with IRS1 protein, suggesting a role in regulating insulin sensitivity. Several transcript variants that differ in the 5' UTR but that encode the same protein have been identified for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Protein ubiquitination controls many intracellular processes, including cell cycle progression, transcriptional activation, and signal transduction. This dynamic process, involving ubiquitin conjugating enzymes and deubiquitinating enzymes, adds and removes ubiquitin. Deubiquitinating enzymes are cysteine proteases that specifically cleave ubiquitin from ubiquitin-conjugated protein substrates. The protein encoded by this gene belongs to a DUB subfamily characterized by an ovarian tumor (OTU) domain. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the DEAH (Asp-Glu-Ala-His) subfamily of proteins, part of the DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box family of RNA helicases. The encoded protein binds to N6-methyladenosine, a common modified RNA nucleotide that is enriched in the stop codons and 3' UTRs of eukaryotic messenger RNAs. Binding of proteins to this modified nucleotide may regulate mRNA translation and stability. This gene may be associated with susceptibility to pancreatic cancer in human patients, and knockdown of this gene resulted in reduced proliferation in a human liver cancer cell line.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the YTH (YT521-B homology) superfamily containing YTH domain. The YTH domain is typical for the eukaryotes and is particularly abundant in plants. The YTH domain is usually located in the middle of the protein sequence and may function in binding to RNA. In addition to a YTH domain, this protein has a proline rich region which may be involved in signal transduction. An Alu-rich domain has been identified in one of the introns of this gene, which is thought to be associated with human longevity. In addition, reciprocal translocations between this gene and the Runx1 (AML1) gene on chromosome 21 has been observed in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. This gene was initially mapped to chromosome 14, which was later turned out to be a pseudogene. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified in this gene.","Variant counts
