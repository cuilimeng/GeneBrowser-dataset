Summary
This gene encodes a large protein that resides in the limiting membrane of endosomes and lysosomes and mediates intracellular cholesterol trafficking via binding of cholesterol to its N-terminal domain. It is predicted to have a cytoplasmic C-terminus, 13 transmembrane domains, and 3 large loops in the lumen of the endosome - the last loop being at the N-terminus. This protein transports low-density lipoproteins to late endosomal/lysosomal compartments where they are hydrolized and released as free cholesterol. Defects in this gene cause Niemann-Pick type C disease, a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by over accumulation of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids in late endosomal/lysosomal compartments.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene product is the founding member of the evolutionarily conserved CAN (Cerberus and DAN) family of proteins, which contain a domain resembling the CTCK (C-terminal cystine knot-like) motif found in a number of signaling molecules. These proteins are secreted, and act as BMP (bone morphogenetic protein) antagonists by binding to BMPs and preventing them from interacting with their receptors. They may thus play an important role during growth and development. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been identified for this gene. Read-through transcripts between this locus and the upstream mitochondrial inner membrane organizing system 1 gene (GeneID 440574) have been observed.","Variant counts

Summary
The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is found on the nuclear envelope and forms a gateway that regulates the flow of proteins and RNAs between the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm. The NPC is comprised of approximately 30 distinct proteins collectively known as nucleoporins. Nucleoporins are pore-complex-specific glycoproteins which often have cytoplasmically oriented O-linked N-acetylglucosamine residues and numerous repeats of the pentapeptide sequence XFXFG. However, the nucleoporin protein encoded by this gene does not contain the typical FG repeat sequences found in most vertebrate nucleoporins. This nucleoporin is thought to form part of the scaffold for the central channel of the nuclear pore.","Variant counts

Members of this Type I transmembrane protein family share structural characteristics including an extracellular domain consisting of multiple epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats, and an intracellular domain consisting of multiple different domain types. Notch signaling is an evolutionarily conserved intercellular signaling pathway that regulates interactions between physically adjacent cells through binding of Notch family receptors to their cognate ligands. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed in the trans-Golgi network to generate two polypeptide chains that heterodimerize to form the mature cell-surface receptor. This receptor may play a role in vascular, renal and hepatic development. Mutations in this gene may be associated with schizophrenia. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, at least one of which encodes an isoform that is proteolytically processed.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the Notch family. Members of this Type 1 transmembrane protein family share structural characteristics including an extracellular domain consisting of multiple epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats, and an intracellular domain consisting of multiple, different domain types. Notch family members play a role in a variety of developmental processes by controlling cell fate decisions. The Notch signaling network is an evolutionarily conserved intercellular signaling pathway which regulates interactions between physically adjacent cells. In Drosophilia, notch interaction with its cell-bound ligands (delta, serrate) establishes an intercellular signaling pathway that plays a key role in development. Homologues of the notch-ligands have also been identified in human, but precise interactions between these ligands and the human notch homologues remain to be determined. This protein is cleaved in the trans-Golgi network, and presented on the cell surface as a heterodimer. This protein functions as a receptor for membrane bound ligands, and may play a role in vascular, renal and hepatic development. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a 7-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor that binds neuromedin B, which is a growth factor and mitogen for gastrointestinal epithelial tissue and for normal and neoplastic lung. This receptor may play a role in smooth muscle contraction, neuronal responses, and the regulation of cell growth. Antagonists of this receptor have a potential therapeutic use in inhibiting tumor cell growth. Polymorphisms in this gene may be associated with a susceptibility for schizophrenia. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The product of this gene belongs to the small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) family of proteins. Defects in this gene are the cause of congenital stationary night blindness type 1 (CSNB1), also called X-linked congenital stationary night blindness (XLCSNB). CSNB1 is a rare inherited retinal disorder characterized by impaired scotopic vision, myopia, hyperopia, nystagmus and reduced visual acuity. The role of other SLRP proteins suggests that mutations in this gene disrupt developing retinal interconnections involving the ON-bipolar cells, leading to the visual losses seen in patients with complete CSNB.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is one subunit of a trimeric complex, forming a highly conserved transcription factor that binds to CCAAT motifs in the promoter regions in a variety of genes. Subunit A associates with a tight dimer composed of the B and C subunits, resulting in a trimer that binds to DNA with high specificity and affinity. The sequence specific interactions of the complex are made by the A subunit, suggesting a role as the regulatory subunit. In addition, there is evidence of post-transcriptional regulation in this gene product, either by protein degradation or control of translation. Further regulation is represented by alternative splicing in the glutamine-rich activation domain, with clear tissue-specific preferences for the two isoforms.","Variant counts

Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) are members of the immunoglobulin superfamily. This gene encodes a neuronal cell adhesion molecule with multiple immunoglobulin-like C2-type domains and fibronectin type-III domains. This ankyrin-binding protein is involved in neuron-neuron adhesion and promotes directional signaling during axonal cone growth. This gene is also expressed in non-neural tissues and may play a general role in cell-cell communication via signaling from its intracellular domain to the actin cytoskeleton during directional cell migration. Allelic variants of this gene have been associated with autism and addiction vulnerability. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

This gene is a member of the ankyrin-repeat family and is induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The C-terminal portion of the encoded product which contains the ankyrin repeats, shares high sequence similarity with the I kappa B family of proteins. The latter are known to play a role in inflammatory responses to LPS by their interaction with NF-B proteins through ankyrin-repeat domains. Studies in mouse indicate that this gene product is one of the nuclear I kappa B proteins and an activator of IL-6 production. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes one of two neuropilins, which contain specific protein domains which allow them to participate in several different types of signaling pathways that control cell migration. Neuropilins contain a large N-terminal extracellular domain, made up of complement-binding, coagulation factor V/VIII, and meprin domains. These proteins also contains a short membrane-spanning domain and a small cytoplasmic domain. Neuropilins bind many ligands and various types of co-receptors; they affect cell survival, migration, and attraction. Some of the ligands and co-receptors bound by neuropilins are vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and semaphorin family members. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants that encode different protein isoforms have been described for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the Fpg/Nei family of DNA glycosylases. These glycosylases initiate the first step in base excision repair by cleaving oxidatively damaged bases and introducing a DNA strand break via their abasic site lyase activity. This enzyme is primarily associated with DNA repair during transcription and acts prefentially on cytosine-derived lesions, particularly 5-hydroxyuracil and 5-hydroxycytosine. It contains an N-terminal catalytic domain, a hinge region, and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain with helix-two-turn-helix and zinc finger motifs. This enzyme interacts with the X-ray cross complementing factor 1 scaffold protein as part of a multi-protein DNA repair complex. A pseudogene of this gene has been identified.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene belongs to the G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily. The encoded transmembrane protein mediates the function of neuropeptide Y (NPY), a neurotransmitter, and peptide YY (PYY), a gastrointestinal hormone. The encoded receptor undergoes fast agonist-induced internalization through clathrin-coated pits and is subsequently recycled back to the cell membrane. Activation of Y1 receptors may result in mobilization of intracellular calcium and inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a 105 kD protein which can undergo cotranslational processing by the 26S proteasome to produce a 50 kD protein. The 105 kD protein is a Rel protein-specific transcription inhibitor and the 50 kD protein is a DNA binding subunit of the NF-kappa-B (NFKB) protein complex. NFKB is a transcription regulator that is activated by various intra- and extra-cellular stimuli such as cytokines, oxidant-free radicals, ultraviolet irradiation, and bacterial or viral products. Activated NFKB translocates into the nucleus and stimulates the expression of genes involved in a wide variety of biological functions. Inappropriate activation of NFKB has been associated with a number of inflammatory diseases while persistent inhibition of NFKB leads to inappropriate immune cell development or delayed cell growth. NFKB is a critical regulator of the immediate-early response to viral infection. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms, at least one of which is proteolytically processed.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a subunit of the transcription factor complex nuclear factor-kappa-B (NFkB). The NFkB complex is expressed in numerous cell types and functions as a central activator of genes involved in inflammation and immune function. The protein encoded by this gene can function as both a transcriptional activator or repressor depending on its dimerization partner. The p100 full-length protein is co-translationally processed into a p52 active form. Chromosomal rearrangements and translocations of this locus have been observed in B cell lymphomas, some of which may result in the formation of fusion proteins. There is a pseudogene for this gene on chromosome 18. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a type I single transmembrane domain receptor, which is a subunit of cis-prenyltransferase, and serves as a specific receptor for the neural and cardiovascular regulator Nogo-B. The encoded protein is essential for dolichol synthesis and protein glycosylation. This gene is highly expressed in non-small cell lung carcinomas as well as estrogen receptor-alpha positive breast cancer cells where it promotes epithelial mesenchymal transition. This gene is associated with the poor prognosis of human hepatocellular carcinoma patients. Naturally occurring mutations in this gene cause a congenital disorder of glycosylation and are associated with epilepsy. A knockout of the orthologous gene in mice causes embryonic lethality before day 6.5. Pseudogenes of this gene have been defined on chromosomes 13 and X.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes the homolog of the Drosophila melanogaster Nipped-B gene product and fungal Scc2-type sister chromatid cohesion proteins. The Drosophila protein facilitates enhancer-promoter communication of remote enhancers and plays a role in developmental regulation. It is also homologous to a family of chromosomal adherins with broad roles in sister chromatid cohesion, chromosome condensation, and DNA repair. The human protein has a bipartite nuclear targeting sequence and a putative HEAT repeat. Condensins, cohesins and other complexes with chromosome-related functions also contain HEAT repeats. Mutations in this gene result in Cornelia de Lange syndrome, a disorder characterized by dysmorphic facial features, growth delay, limb reduction defects, and cognitive disability. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the Nudix hydrolase family. Nudix hydrolases eliminate potentially toxic nucleotide metabolites from the cell and regulate the concentrations and availability of many different nucleotide substrates, cofactors, and signaling molecules. This enzyme contains a Nudix hydrolase domain and is a UDPG pyrophosphatase that hydrolyzes UDPG to produce glucose 1-phosphate and UMP. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Myristate, a rare 14-carbon saturated fatty acid, is cotranslationally attached by an amide linkage to the N-terminal glycine residue of cellular and viral proteins with diverse functions. N-myristoyltransferase (NMT; EC 2.3.1.97) catalyzes the transfer of myristate from CoA to proteins. N-myristoylation appears to be irreversible and is required for full expression of the biologic activities of several N-myristoylated proteins, including the alpha subunit of the signal-transducing guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) GO (GNAO1; MIM 139311) (Duronio et al., 1992 [PubMed 1570339]).","Variant counts

Summary
Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) regulate the transport of macromolecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm, and are composed of many polypeptide subunits, many of which belong to the nucleoporin family. This gene belongs to the nucleoporin gene family and encodes a 186 kDa precursor protein that undergoes autoproteolytic cleavage to generate a 98 kDa nucleoporin and 96 kDa nucleoporin. The 98 kDa nucleoporin contains a Gly-Leu-Phe-Gly (GLGF) repeat domain and participates in many cellular processes, including nuclear import, nuclear export, mitotic progression, and regulation of gene expression. The 96 kDa nucleoporin is a scaffold component of the NPC. Proteolytic cleavage is important for targeting of the proteins to the NPC. Translocations between this gene and many other partner genes have been observed in different leukemias. Rearrangements typically result in chimeras with the N-terminal GLGF domain of this gene to the C-terminus of the partner gene. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms, at least two of which are proteolytically processed. Some variants lack the region that encodes the 96 kDa nucleoporin.","Variant counts

Summary
The nuclear pore complex is a massive structure that extends across the nuclear envelope, forming a gateway that regulates the flow of macromolecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Nucleoporins are the main components of the nuclear pore complex in eukaryotic cells. This gene encodes a nucleoporin protein that localizes both to the basket of the pore and to the nuclear entry of the central gated channel of the pore. The encoded protein is a target of caspase cysteine proteases that play a central role in programmed cell death by apoptosis. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
The secreted polypeptide, encoded by this gene, binds and inactivates members of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily signaling proteins, such as bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP4). By diffusing through extracellular matrices more efficiently than members of the TGF-beta superfamily, this protein may have a principal role in creating morphogenic gradients. The protein appears to have pleiotropic effect, both early in development as well as in later stages. It was originally isolated from Xenopus based on its ability to restore normal dorsal-ventral body axis in embryos that had been artificially ventralized by UV treatment. The results of the mouse knockout of the ortholog suggest that it is involved in numerous developmental processes, such as neural tube fusion and joint formation. Recently, several dominant human NOG mutations in unrelated families with proximal symphalangism (SYM1) and multiple synostoses syndrome (SYNS1) were identified; both SYM1 and SYNS1 have multiple joint fusion as their principal feature, and map to the same region (17q22) as this gene. All of these mutations altered evolutionarily conserved amino acid residues. The amino acid sequence of this human gene is highly homologous to that of Xenopus, rat and mouse.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a cytosolic protein that binds to the signaling molecule, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). This protein has a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain that mediates interactions with nNOS and an N-terminal phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain that binds to the small monomeric G protein, Dexras1. Studies of the related mouse and rat proteins have shown that this protein functions as an adapter protein linking nNOS to specific targets, such as Dexras1 and the synapsins. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes an enzyme that functions in the biosynthetic pathways of sialic acids. In vitro, the encoded protein uses N-acetylmannosamine 6-phosphate and mannose 6-phosphate as substrates to generate phosphorylated forms of N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-nononic acid (KDN), respectively; however, it exhibits much higher activity toward the Neu5Ac phosphate product. In insect cells, expression of this gene results in Neu5Ac and KDN production. This gene is related to the E. coli sialic acid synthase gene neuB, and it can partially restore sialic acid synthase activity in an E. coli neuB-negative mutant.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the NimA (never in mitosis A) family of serine/threonine protein kinases. The encoded protein differs from other NimA family members in that it is not cell cycle regulated and is found primarily in the cytoplasm. The kinase is activated by prolactin stimulation, leading to phosphorylation of VAV2 guanine nucleotide exchange factor, paxillin, and activation of the RAC1 GTPase. Two functional alleles for this gene have been identified in humans. The reference genome assembly (GRCh38) represents a functional allele that is associated with the inclusion of an additional coding exon in protein-coding transcripts, compared to an alternate functional allele that lacks the exon.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein containing a SET domain, 2 LXXLL motifs, 3 nuclear translocation signals (NLSs), 4 plant homeodomain (PHD) finger regions, and a proline-rich region. The encoded protein enhances androgen receptor (AR) transactivation, and this enhancement can be increased further in the presence of other androgen receptor associated coregulators. This protein may act as a nucleus-localized, basic transcriptional factor and also as a bifunctional transcriptional regulator. Mutations of this gene have been associated with Sotos syndrome and Weaver syndrome. One version of childhood acute myeloid leukemia is the result of a cryptic translocation with the breakpoints occurring within nuclear receptor-binding Su-var, enhancer of zeste, and trithorax domain protein 1 on chromosome 5 and nucleoporin, 98-kd on chromosome 11. Multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been identified for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that contains four domains present in other developmental proteins: a PWWP domain, an HMG box, a SET domain, and a PHD-type zinc finger. It is expressed ubiquitously in early development. Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS) is a malformation syndrome associated with a hemizygous deletion of the distal short arm of chromosome 4. This gene maps to the 165 kb WHS critical region and has also been involved in the chromosomal translocation t(4;14)(p16.3;q32.3) in multiple myelomas. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. Some transcript variants are nonsense-mediated mRNA (NMD) decay candidates, hence not represented as reference sequences.","Variant counts

This protein and Nocturnin protein share similarity with the C-terminal domain of a yeast transcription factor, carbon catabolite repression 4 (CCR4). The mRNA abundance of a similar gene in mouse has been shown to exhibit circadian rhythmicity, which suggests a role for this protein in clock function or as a circadian clock effector.","Variant counts

Summary
Iron-sulfur clusters are required for the function of many cellular enzymes. The proteins encoded by this gene supply inorganic sulfur to these clusters by removing the sulfur from cysteine, creating alanine in the process. This gene uses alternate in-frame translation initiation sites to generate mitochondrial forms and cytoplasmic/nuclear forms. Selection of the alternative initiation sites is determined by the cytosolic pH. The encoded proteins belong to the class-V family of pyridoxal phosphate-dependent aminotransferases. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the neuroblastoma breakpoint family (NBPF) which consists of dozens of recently duplicated genes primarily located in segmental duplications on human chromosome 1. This gene family has experienced its greatest expansion within the human lineage and has expanded, to a lesser extent, among primates in general. Members of this gene family are characterized by tandemly repeated copies of DUF1220 protein domains. Gene copy number variations in the human chromosomal region 1q21.1, where most DUF1220 domains are located, have been implicated in a number of developmental and neurogenetic diseases such as microcephaly, macrocephaly, autism, schizophrenia, cognitive disability, congenital heart disease, neuroblastoma, and congenital kidney and urinary tract anomalies.

Summary
This gene encodes a subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I), which functions in the transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain. The protein is required for complex I assembly and electron transfer activity. The protein binds the signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) transcription factor, and can function as a tumor suppressor. The human protein purified from mitochondria migrates at approximately 16 kDa. Transcripts originating from an upstream promoter and capable of expressing a protein with a longer N-terminus have been found, but their biological validity has not been determined.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor family that activate a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system. Binding and pharmacological studies demonstrate that this receptor binds neurotensin as well as several other ligands already described for neurotensin NT1 receptor. However, unlike NT1 receptor, this gene recognizes, with high affinity, levocabastine, a histamine H1 receptor antagonist previously shown to compete with neurotensin for low-affinity binding sites in brain. These activities suggest that this receptor may be of physiological importance and that a natural agonist for the receptor may exist.","Variant counts

This protein is part of a large family of nuclear receptor transcription factors involved in signaling pathways. Nuclear receptors have been shown to regulate pathways involved in embryonic development, as well as in maintenance of proper cell function in adults. Members of this family are characterized by discrete domains that function in DNA and ligand binding. This gene encodes a retinal nuclear receptor that is a ligand-dependent transcription factor. Defects in this gene are a cause of enhanced S cone syndrome. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified.","Variant counts

Nop56p is a yeast nucleolar protein that is part of a complex with the nucleolar proteins Nop58p and fibrillarin. Nop56p is required for assembly of the 60S ribosomal subunit and is involved in pre-rRNA processing. The protein encoded by this gene is similar in sequence to Nop56p and is also found in the nucleolus. Expansion of a GGCCTG repeat from 3-8 copies to 1500-2500 copies in an intron of this gene results in spinocerebellar ataxia 36. Multiple transcript variants encoding several different isoforms have been found for this gene, but the full-length nature of most of them has not been determined.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that is highly similar to yeast Nuf2, a component of a conserved protein complex associated with the centromere. Yeast Nuf2 disappears from the centromere during meiotic prophase when centromeres lose their connection to the spindle pole body, and plays a regulatory role in chromosome segregation. The encoded protein is found to be associated with centromeres of mitotic HeLa cells, which suggests that this protein is a functional homolog of yeast Nuf2. Alternatively spliced transcript variants that encode the same protein have been described.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the family of nitric oxide synthases, which synthesize nitric oxide from L-arginine. Nitric oxide is a reactive free radical, which acts as a biologic mediator in several processes, including neurotransmission, and antimicrobial and antitumoral activities. In the brain and peripheral nervous system, nitric oxide displays many properties of a neurotransmitter, and has been implicated in neurotoxicity associated with stroke and neurodegenerative diseases, neural regulation of smooth muscle, including peristalsis, and penile erection. This protein is ubiquitously expressed, with high level of expression in skeletal muscle. Multiple transcript variants that differ in the 5' UTR have been described for this gene but the full-length nature of these transcripts is not known. Additionally, alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms (some testis-specific) have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a cell adhesion protein which is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The encoded protein is involved in cell-to-cell interactions as well as cell-matrix interactions during development and differentiation. The encoded protein plays a role in the development of the nervous system by regulating neurogenesis, neurite outgrowth, and cell migration. This protein is also involved in the expansion of T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells which play an important role in immune surveillance. This protein plays a role in signal transduction by interacting with fibroblast growth factor receptors, N-cadherin and other components of the extracellular matrix and by triggering signalling cascades involving FYN-focal adhesion kinase (FAK), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). One prominent isoform of this gene, cell surface molecule CD56, plays a role in several myeloproliferative disorders such as acute myeloid leukemia and differential expression of this gene is associated with differential disease progression. For example, increased expression of CD56 is correlated with lower survival in acute myeloid leukemia patients whereas increased severity of COVID-19 is correlated with decreased abundance of CD56-expressing NK cells in peripheral blood. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct protein isoforms.","Variant counts

The nuclear envelope creates distinct nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments in eukaryotic cells. It consists of two concentric membranes perforated by nuclear pores, large protein complexes that form aqueous channels to regulate the flow of macromolecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. These complexes are composed of at least 100 different polypeptide subunits, many of which belong to the nucleoporin family. The nucleoporin protein encoded by this gene displays evolutionarily conserved interactions with other nucleoporins. This protein, which localizes to both sides of the nuclear pore complex at interphase, remains associated with the complex during mitosis and is targeted at early stages to the reforming nuclear envelope. This protein also localizes to kinetochores of mitotic cells.","Variant counts

Summary
The NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex (complex I) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain catalyzes the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, and consists of at least 43 subunits. The complex is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This gene encodes a mitochondrial protein that is associated with the matrix face of the mitochondrial inner membrane and is required for complex I assembly. A mutation in this gene results in mitochondrial complex I deficiency. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes an assembly factor protein which helps in the assembly and stabilization of Complex I, a large multi-subunit enzyme in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Complex I is involved in several physiological activities in the cell, including metabolite transport and ATP synthesis. The encoded protein is a methyltransferase which methylates Arg85 of a subunit of Complex I in the early stages of its assembly. A pseudogene related to this gene is located on chromosome 8. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is one member of a family of nuclear RNA export factor genes. Common domain features of this family are a noncanonical RNP-type RNA-binding domain (RBD), 4 leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), a nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2)-like domain that allows heterodimerization with NTF2-related export protein-1 (NXT1), and a ubiquitin-associated domain that mediates interactions with nucleoporins. The LRRs and NTF2-like domains are required for export activity. Alternative splicing seems to be a common mechanism in this gene family. The encoded protein of this gene shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and binds in vivo to poly(A)+ RNA. It is the vertebrate homologue of the yeast protein Mex67p. The encoded protein overcomes the mRNA export block caused by the presence of saturating amounts of CTE (constitutive transport element) RNA of type D retroviruses. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the Nedd4 family of HECT domain E3 ubiquitin ligases. HECT domain E3 ubiquitin ligases transfer ubiquitin from E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes to protein substrates, thus targeting specific proteins for lysosomal degradation. The encoded protein mediates the ubiquitination of multiple target substrates and plays a critical role in epithelial sodium transport by regulating the cell surface expression of the epithelial sodium channel, ENaC. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in this gene may be associated with essential hypertension. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene.","Variant counts

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is essential for life in all organisms, both as a coenzyme for oxidoreductases and as a source of ADP-ribosyl groups used in various reactions. Nicotinic acid and nicotinamide, collectively known as niacin, are the vitamin precursors of NAD+. Nicotinamide riboside kinases, such as NRK1, function to synthesize NAD+ through nicotinamide mononucleotide using nicotinamide riboside as the precursor (Bieganowski and Brenner, 2004 [PubMed 15137942]).","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene binds arginine-vasopressin and may be involved in the arginine-vasopressin-mediated regulation of renal salt-water balance. The encoded protein also mediates inflammatory responses in the colon to allow recovery from intestinal epithelial damage and protects against tumorigenesis and the development of colitis. Finally, this protein can increase activation of NF-kappa-B, activation of CASP1 through interaction with ASC, and cAMP accumulation. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the Ced-4 family of apoptosis proteins. Ced-family members contain a caspase recruitment domain (CARD) and are known to be key mediators of programmed cell death. The encoded protein contains a distinct N-terminal pyrin-like motif, which is possibly involved in protein-protein interactions. This protein interacts strongly with caspase 2 and weakly with caspase 9. Overexpression of this gene was demonstrated to induce apoptosis in cells. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been found for this gene, but the biological validity of some variants has not been determined.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a pyrin-like protein containing a pyrin domain, a nucleotide-binding site (NBS) domain, and a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motif. This protein interacts with the apoptosis-associated speck-like protein PYCARD/ASC, which contains a caspase recruitment domain, and is a member of the NLRP3 inflammasome complex. This complex functions as an upstream activator of NF-kappaB signaling, and it plays a role in the regulation of inflammation, the immune response, and apoptosis. The SARS-CoV 3a protein, a transmembrane pore-forming viroporin, has been shown to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome via the formation of ion channels in macrophages. Mutations in this gene are associated with familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS), Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS), chronic infantile neurological cutaneous and articular (CINCA) syndrome, neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID), keratoendotheliitis fugax hereditarian, and deafness, autosomal dominant 34, with or without inflammation. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been identified for this gene. Alternative 5' UTR structures are suggested by available data; however, insufficient evidence is available to determine if all of the represented 5' UTR splice patterns are biologically valid.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat receptor (NLR) family, and is predicted to contain an N-terminal pyrin effector domain (PYD), a centrally-located nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NACHT) and C-terminal leucine-rich repeats (LRR). Members of this gene family are thought to be important regulators of immune responses. This gene product interacts with components of the IkB kinase (IKK) complex, and can regulate both caspase-1 and NF-kB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) activity. The pyrin domain is necessary and sufficient for suppression of NF-kB activity. An allelic variant (rs147585490) has been found that is incapable of blocking the transcriptional activity of NF-kB. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a membrane glycoprotein that mediates cell-cell signaling and plays a critical role in the growth and development of multiple organ systems. An extraordinary variety of different isoforms are produced from this gene through alternative promoter usage and splicing. These isoforms are expressed in a tissue-specific manner and differ significantly in their structure, and are classified as types I, II, III, IV, V and VI. Dysregulation of this gene has been linked to diseases such as cancer, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder (BPD).","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the neuregulin gene family. This gene family encodes ligands for the transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors ERBB3 and ERBB4 - members of the epidermal growth factor receptor family. Ligand binding activates intracellular signaling cascades and the induction of cellular responses including proliferation, migration, differentiation, and survival or apoptosis. This gene encodes neuregulin 3 (NRG3). NRG3 has been shown to activate the tyrosine phosphorylation of its cognate receptor, ERBB4, and is thought to influence neuroblast proliferation, migration and differentiation by signalling through ERBB4. NRG3 also promotes mammary differentiation during embryogenesis. Linkage studies have implicated this gene as a susceptibility locus for schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms. Additional transcript variants have been described but their biological validity has not been verified.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a novel member of the neuregulin family of growth and differentiation factors. Through interaction with the ERBB family of receptors, this protein induces the growth and differentiation of epithelial, neuronal, glial, and other types of cells. The gene consists of 12 exons and the genomic structure is similar to that of neuregulin 1, another member of the neuregulin family of ligands. The products of these genes mediate distinct biological processes by acting at different sites in tissues and eliciting different biological responses in cells. This gene is located close to the region for demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease locus, but is not responsible for this disease. Alternative transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been described.","Variant counts

Summary
Neurogranin (NRGN) is the human homolog of the neuron-specific rat RC3/neurogranin gene. This gene encodes a postsynaptic protein kinase substrate that binds calmodulin in the absence of calcium. The NRGN gene contains four exons and three introns. The exons 1 and 2 encode the protein and exons 3 and 4 contain untranslated sequences. It is suggested that the NRGN is a direct target for thyroid hormone in human brain, and that control of expression of this gene could underlay many of the consequences of hypothyroidism on mental states during development as well as in adult subjects.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a multi-pass membrane protein. It contains a conserved N-terminal Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) domain and a putative sterol-sensing domain (SSD) which includes a YQRL motif functioning as a plasma membrane to trans-Golgi network transport signal in other proteins. This protein takes up free cholesterol into cells through vesicular endocytosis and plays a critical role in the absorption of intestinal cholesterol. It also has the ability to transport alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E). The drug ezetimibe targets this protein and inhibits the absorption of intestinal cholesterol and alpha-tocopherol. In addition, this protein may play a critical role in regulating lipid metabolism. Polymorphic variations in this gene are associated with plasma total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and coronary heart disease (CHD) risk. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Guanylyl cyclases, catalyzing the production of cGMP from GTP, are classified as soluble and membrane forms (Garbers and Lowe, 1994 [PubMed 7982997]). The membrane guanylyl cyclases, often termed guanylyl cyclases A through F, form a family of cell-surface receptors with a similar topographic structure: an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a single membrane-spanning domain, and an intracellular region that contains a protein kinase-like domain and a cyclase catalytic domain. GC-A and GC-B function as receptors for natriuretic peptides; they are also referred to as atrial natriuretic peptide receptor A (NPR1) and type B (NPR2; MIM 108961). Also see NPR3 (MIM 108962), which encodes a protein with only the ligand-binding transmembrane and 37-amino acid cytoplasmic domains. NPR1 is a membrane-bound guanylate cyclase that serves as the receptor for both atrial and brain natriuretic peptides (ANP (MIM 108780) and BNP (MIM 600295), respectively).","Variant counts

Summary
The liver X receptors, LXRA (NR1H3; MIM 602423) and LXRB, form a subfamily of the nuclear receptor superfamily and are key regulators of macrophage function, controlling transcriptional programs involved in lipid homeostasis and inflammation. The inducible LXRA is highly expressed in liver, adrenal gland, intestine, adipose tissue, macrophages, lung, and kidney, whereas LXRB is ubiquitously expressed. Ligand-activated LXRs form obligate heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXRs; see MIM 180245) and regulate expression of target genes containing LXR response elements (summary by Korf et al., 2009 [PubMed 19436111]).","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a neuropeptide that is widely expressed in the central nervous system and influences many physiological processes, including cortical excitability, stress response, food intake, circadian rhythms, and cardiovascular function. The neuropeptide functions through G protein-coupled receptors to inhibit adenylyl cyclase, activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), regulate intracellular calcium levels, and activate potassium channels. A polymorphism in this gene resulting in a change of leucine 7 to proline in the signal peptide is associated with elevated cholesterol levels, higher alcohol consumption, and may be a risk factor for various metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. The protein also exhibits antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene is a homeobox-containing developmental regulator associated with liver development. The encoded protein binds to the alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) gene promoter and increases the expression of AFP. This gene is overexpressed in some lung cancers and is linked to poor patient survival, possibly due to its resistance to cisplatin. This gene is aberrantly methylated in pancreatic cancer, deleted in squamous cell lung carcinomas, and acts as a tumor suppressor in esophageal cancer. Mutations in this gene may also be a cause of neural tube defects.","Variant counts

Three different versions of extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas (EMCs) are the result of reciprocal translocations between this gene and other genes. The translocation breakpoints are associated with Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 3 (on chromosome 9) and either Ewing Sarcome Breakpoint Region 1 (on chromosome 22), RNA Polymerase II, TATA Box-Binding Protein-Associated Factor, 68-KD (on chromosome 17), or Transcription factor 12 (on chromosome 15). Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a subunit of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complex I (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide: ubiquinone oxidoreductase). Complex I is localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane and functions to dehydrogenate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and to shuttle electrons to coenzyme Q. Complex I deficiency is the most common defect found in oxidative phosphorylation disorders and results in a range of conditions, including lethal neonatal disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, liver disease, and adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders. Pseudogenes of this gene are found on chromosomes five, seven and eight. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the N-acetylated alpha-linked acidic dipeptidase (NAALADase) gene family. The representative member of this family is the gene encoding human prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSM), which is a marker of prostatic carcinomas and is the first to be shown to possess NAALADase activity. NAALADase cleaves N-acetyl-L-aspartate-L-glutamate (NAAG), which is a neuropeptide expressed both in the central nervous systems and in the periphery and is thought to function as a neurotransmitter. The product of this gene is a type II integral membrane protein. Transient transfection of this gene confers both NAALADase and dipetidyl peptidase IV activities to mammalian cells. This gene is highly expressed in ovary and testis as well as within discrete brain areas. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of a family of proteins that function in the nervous system as receptors and cell adhesion molecules. Extensive alternative splicing and the use of alternative promoters results in multiple transcript variants and protein isoforms for this gene, but the full-length nature of many of these variants has not been determined. Transcripts that initiate from an upstream promoter encode alpha isoforms, which contain epidermal growth factor-like (EGF-like) sequences and laminin G domains. Transcripts initiating from the downstream promoter encode beta isoforms, which lack EGF-like sequences. Genetic variation at this locus has been associated with a range of behavioral phenotypes, including alcohol dependence and autism spectrum disorder.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the neurexin gene family. The products of these genes function as cell adhesion molecules and receptors in the vertebrate nervous system. These genes utilize two promoters. The majority of transcripts are produced from the upstream promoter and encode alpha-neurexin isoforms while a smaller number of transcripts are produced from the downstream promoter and encode beta-neuresin isoforms. The alpha-neurexins contain epidermal growth factor-like (EGF-like) sequences and laminin G domains, and have been shown to interact with neurexophilins. The beta-neurexins lack EGF-like sequences and contain fewer laminin G domains than alpha-neurexins. Alternative splicing and the use of alternative promoters may generate thousands of transcript variants (PMID: 12036300, PMID: 11944992).","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a single-pass type I membrane protein that belongs to the neurexin family. Neurexins are cell-surface receptors that bind neuroligins to form Ca(2+)-dependent neurexin/neuroligin complexes at synapses in the central nervous system. This complex is required for efficient neurotransmission and is involved in the formation of synaptic contacts. Three members of this gene family have been studied in detail and are estimated to generate over 3,000 variants through the use of two alternative promoters (alpha and beta) and extensive alternative splicing in each family member. Recently, a third promoter (gamma) was identified for this gene in the 3' region. Mutations in this gene are associated with Pitt-Hopkins-like syndrome-2 and may contribute to susceptibility to schizophrenia.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein with two coiled-coil domains that localizes to kinetochores, which are chromosome-associated structures that attach to microtubules and mediate chromosome movements during cell division. The encoded protein is part of a conserved protein complex that includes two chromodomain-containing proteins and a component of the outer plate of the kinetochore. This protein complex is proposed to bridge centromeric heterochromatin with the outer kinetochore structure. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. There is a pseudogene of the 3' UTR region of this gene on chromosome X.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the family of neuronal petraxins, synaptic proteins that are related to C-reactive protein. This protein is involved in excitatory synapse formation. It also plays a role in clustering of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-type glutamate receptors at established synapses, resulting in non-apoptotic cell death of dopaminergic nerve cells. Up-regulation of this gene in Parkinson disease (PD) tissues suggests that the protein may be involved in the pathology of PD.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a member of the neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) family of calcium-binding proteins. The protein contains an N-terminal myristoylation signal and four EF-hand calcium binding loops. The protein is cytosolic at resting calcium levels; however, elevated intracellular calcium levels induce a conformational change that exposes the myristoyl group, resulting in protein association with membranes and partial co-localization with the perinuclear trans-golgi network. The protein is thought to be a regulator of G protein-coupled receptor signal transduction. Several alternatively spliced variants of this gene have been determined, all of which encode the same protein; additional variants may exist but their biological validity has not been determined.","Variant counts

This gene is a member of the nudix (nucleoside diphosphate linked moiety X)-type motif containing family. The encoded protein is a phosphohydrolase and may regulate the turnover of diphosphoinositol polyphosphates. The turnover of these high-energy diphosphoinositol polyphosphates represents a molecular switching activity with important regulatory consequences. Molecular switching by diphosphoinositol polyphosphates may contribute to the regulation of intracellular trafficking. In some populations putative prostate cancer susceptibility alleles have been identified for this gene. Alternatively spliced transcript variants, which differ only in the 5' UTR, have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes an enzyme that belongs to the Nudix hydrolase superfamily. Members of this superfamily catalyze the hydrolysis of nucleoside diphosphates, including substrates like 8-oxo-dGTP, which are a result of oxidative damage, and can induce base mispairing during DNA replication, causing transversions. The encoded enzyme is a negative regulator of thiopurine activation and toxicity. Mutations in this gene result in poor metabolism of thiopurines, and are associated with thiopurine-induced early leukopenia. Multiple pseudogenes of this gene have been identified.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes nebulin, a giant protein component of the cytoskeletal matrix that coexists with the thick and thin filaments within the sarcomeres of skeletal muscle. In most vertebrates, nebulin accounts for 3 to 4% of the total myofibrillar protein. The encoded protein contains approximately 30-amino acid long modules that can be classified into 7 types and other repeated modules. Protein isoform sizes vary from 600 to 800 kD due to alternative splicing that is tissue-, species-,and developmental stage-specific. Of the 183 exons in the nebulin gene, at least 43 are alternatively spliced, although exons 143 and 144 are not found in the same transcript. Of the several thousand transcript variants predicted for nebulin, the RefSeq Project has decided to create three representative RefSeq records. Mutations in this gene are associated with recessive nemaline myopathy.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that associates with basic transcription factor 3 (BTF3) to form the nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC). This complex binds to nascent proteins that lack a signal peptide motif as they emerge from the ribosome, blocking interaction with the signal recognition particle (SRP) and preventing mistranslocation to the endoplasmic reticulum. This protein is an IgE autoantigen in atopic dermatitis patients. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, but the full length nature of some of these variants, including those encoding very large proteins, has not been determined. There are multiple pseudogenes of this gene on different chromosomes.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a nonadrenergic imidazoline-1 receptor protein that localizes to the cytosol and anchors to the inner layer of the plasma membrane. The orthologous mouse protein has been shown to influence cytoskeletal organization and cell migration by binding to alpha-5-beta-1 integrin. In humans, this protein has been shown to bind to the adapter insulin receptor substrate 4 (IRS4) to mediate translocation of alpha-5 integrin from the cell membrane to endosomes. Expression of this protein was reduced in human breast cancers while its overexpression reduced tumor growth and metastasis; possibly by limiting the expression of alpha-5 integrin. In human cardiac tissue, this gene was found to affect cell growth and death while in neural tissue it affected neuronal growth and differentiation. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding differerent isoforms. Some isoforms lack the expected C-terminal domains of a functional imidazoline receptor.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene functions in a step-wise process of protein degradation through the N-end rule pathway. This protein acts as a tertiary destabilizing enzyme that deamidates N-terminal L-Asn residues on proteins to produce N-terminal L-Asp. L-Asp substrates are subsequently conjugated to L-Arg, which is recognized by specific E3 ubiquitin ligases and targeted to the proteasome. Pseudogenes of this gene are located on the long arms of chromosomes 8, 10 and 12. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants that encode different protein isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a voltage-independent, nonselective cation channel which belongs to a family of voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels that regulates the resting membrane potential and excitability of neurons. This family is expressed throughout the nervous system and conducts a persistent sodium leak current that contributes to tonic neuronal excitability. The encoded protein forms a channelosome complex that includes G-protein-coupled receptors, UNC-79, UNC-80, NCA localization factor-1, and src family tyrosine kinases. Naturally occurring mutations in this gene are associated with infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy, infantile hypotonia with psychomotor retardation and characteristic facies (IHPRF) syndrome, and congenital contractures of the limbs and face with hypotonia and developmental delay (CLIFAHDD) syndrome. A knockout of the orthologous gene in mice results in paralysis with a severely disrupted respiratory rhythm, and lethality within 24 hours after birth.","Variant counts

Summary
The human NDUFA1 gene codes for an essential component of complex I of the respiratory chain, which transfers electrons from NADH to ubiquinone. It has been noted that the N-terminal hydrophobic domain has the potential to be folded into an alpha-helix spanning the inner mitochondrial membrane with a C-terminal hydrophilic domain interacting with globular subunits of complex I. The highly conserved two-domain structure suggests that this feature is critical for the protein function and might act as an anchor for the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex at the inner mitochondrial membrane. However, the NDUFA1 peptide is one of about 31 components of the 'hydrophobic protein' (HP) fraction of complex I which is involved in proton translocation. Thus the NDUFA1 peptide may also participate in that function.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is located in the nuclear envelope. It has protein similarity to nuclear transport factor 2. This protein functions as a nuclear export factor in both RAN (Ras-related nuclear protein)- and CRM1 (required for chromosome region maintenance)-dependent pathways. It is found to stimulate the export of U1 snRNA in RAN- and CRM1-dependent pathways and the export of tRNA and mRNA in a CRM1-independent pathway. The encoded protein heterodimerizes with Tap protein and may regulate the ability of Tap protein to mediate nuclear mRNA export. The use of alternate polyadenylation sites has been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The N-acetylglutamate synthase gene encodes a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the formation of N-acetylglutamate (NAG) from glutamate and acetyl coenzyme-A. NAG is a cofactor of carbamyl phosphate synthetase I (CPSI), the first enzyme of the urea cycle in mammals. This gene may regulate ureagenesis by altering NAG availability and, thereby, CPSI activity. Deficiencies in N-acetylglutamate synthase have been associated with hyperammonemia.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that belongs to the nuclear hormone receptor family. Members of this family act as ligand-activated transcription factors and function in many biological processes such as development, cellular differentiation and homeostasis. The activated receptor/ligand complex is translocated to the nucleus where it binds to hormone response elements of target genes. The protein encoded by this gene plays a role in protecting cells from oxidative stress and damage induced by ionizing radiation. The lack of a similar gene in mouse results in growth retardation, severe spinal curvature, subfertility, premature aging, and prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) development. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes an integral protein of the inner mitochondrial membrane. The enzyme couples hydride transfer between NAD(H) and NADP(+) to proton translocation across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Under most physiological conditions, the enzyme uses energy from the mitochondrial proton gradient to produce high concentrations of NADPH. The resulting NADPH is used for biosynthesis and in free radical detoxification.","Variant counts

Summary
The nucleolus is a dense subnuclear membraneless organelle that assembles around clusters of rRNA genes and functions in ribosome biogenesis. This gene encodes a nucleolar RNA-associated protein that is highly conserved between species. RNase treatment of permeabilized cells indicates that the nucleolar localization is RNA dependent. Further studies suggest that the protein is associated with ribosome biogenesis through an interaction with pre-rRNA primary transcripts. Alternative splicing has been observed at this locus and two splice variants encoding distinct isoforms have been identified.","Variant counts

Summary
Misincorporation of oxidized nucleoside triphosphates into DNA/RNA during replication and transcription can cause mutations that may result in carcinogenesis or neurodegeneration. The protein encoded by this gene is an enzyme that hydrolyzes oxidized purine nucleoside triphosphates, such as 8-oxo-dGTP, 8-oxo-dATP, 2-hydroxy-dATP, and 2-hydroxy rATP, to monophosphates, thereby preventing misincorporation. The encoded protein is localized mainly in the cytoplasm, with some in the mitochondria, suggesting that it is involved in the sanitization of nucleotide pools both for nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants, some of which encode distinct isoforms, have been identified. Additional variants have been observed, but their full-length natures have not been determined. A rare single-nucleotide polymorphism that results in the production of an additional, longer isoform (p26) has been described.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the MutT family of nucleotide pyrophosphatases, a subset of the larger NUDIX hydrolase family. The gene product possesses a modification of the MutT sequence motif found in certain nucleotide pyrophosphatases. The enzyme asymmetrically hydrolyzes Ap4A to yield AMP and ATP and is responsible for maintaining the intracellular level of the dinucleotide Ap4A, the function of which has yet to be established. This gene may be a candidate tumor suppressor gene. Alternative splicing has been observed at this locus and four transcript variants, all encoding the same protein, have been identified.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene regulates the turnover of diphosphoinositol polyphosphates. The turnover of these high-energy diphosphoinositol polyphosphates represents a molecular switching activity with important regulatory consequences. Molecular switching by diphosphoinositol polyphosphates may contribute to regulating intracellular trafficking. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described, but the full-length nature of some variants has not been determined. Isoforms DIPP2alpha and DIPP2beta are distinguishable from each other solely by DIPP2beta possessing one additional amino acid due to intron boundary skidding in alternate splicing.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene belongs to the Nudix (nucleoside diphosphate linked moiety X) hydrolase superfamily. The encoded enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of modified nucleoside diphosphates, including ADP-ribose (ADPR) and 8-oxoGua-containing 8-oxo-dADP and 8-oxo-dGDP. Protein-bound ADP ribose can be hazardous to the cell because it can modify some amino acid residues, resulting in the inhibition of ATP-activated potassium channels. 8-oxoGua is an oxidized form of guanine that can potentially alter genetic information by pairing with adenine and cytosine in RNA. Presence of 8-oxoGua in RNA results in formation of abnormal proteins due to translational errors.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a nuclear receptor co-repressor that mediates transcriptional silencing of certain target genes. The encoded protein is a member of a family of thyroid hormone- and retinoic acid receptor-associated co-repressors. This protein acts as part of a multisubunit complex which includes histone deacetylases to modify chromatin structure that prevents basal transcriptional activity of target genes. Aberrant expression of this gene is associated with certain cancers. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes an adhesion protein that plays a role in the organization of adherens junctions and tight junctions in epithelial and endothelial cells. The protein is a calcium(2+)-independent cell-cell adhesion molecule that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily and has 3 extracellular immunoglobulin-like loops, a single transmembrane domain (in some isoforms), and a cytoplasmic region. This protein acts as a receptor for glycoprotein D (gD) of herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 (HSV-1, HSV-2), and pseudorabies virus (PRV) and mediates viral entry into epithelial and neuronal cells. Mutations in this gene cause cleft lip and palate/ectodermal dysplasia 1 syndrome (CLPED1) as well as non-syndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P). Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding proteins with distinct C-termini.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the nectin family. The encoded protein contains two immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) C2-type domains and one Ig-like V-type domain. It is involved in cell adhesion through trans-homophilic and -heterophilic interactions. It is a single-pass type I membrane protein. The soluble form is produced by proteolytic cleavage at the cell surface by the metalloproteinase ADAM17/TACE. The secreted form is found in both breast tumor cell lines and breast tumor patients. Mutations in this gene are the cause of ectodermal dysplasia-syndactyly syndrome type 1, an autosomal recessive disorder. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found but the full-length nature of the variant has not been determined.","Variant counts

Summary
MHC class II gene expression is controlled primarily at the transcriptional level by transcription factors that bind to the X and Y boxes, two highly conserved elements in the proximal promoter of MHC class II genes. The protein encoded by this gene is a transcriptional repressor capable of binding to the conserved X box motif of HLA-DRA and other MHC class II genes in vitro. The protein may play a role in regulating the duration of an inflammatory response by limiting the period in which class II MHC molecules are induced by IFN-gamma. Three alternative splice variants, each of which encodes a different isoform, have been identified.","Variant counts

Summary
This is an N-ras oncogene encoding a membrane protein that shuttles between the Golgi apparatus and the plasma membrane. This shuttling is regulated through palmitoylation and depalmitoylation by the ZDHHC9-GOLGA7 complex. The encoded protein, which has intrinsic GTPase activity, is activated by a guanine nucleotide-exchange factor and inactivated by a GTPase activating protein. Mutations in this gene have been associated with somatic rectal cancer, follicular thyroid cancer, autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome, Noonan syndrome, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a core subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (complex I). Mammalian mitochondrial complex I is composed of at least 43 different subunits, 7 of which are encoded by the mitochondrial genome, and the rest are the products of nuclear genes. The iron-sulfur protein fraction of complex I is made up of 7 subunits, including this gene product. Complex I catalyzes the NADH oxidation with concomitant ubiquinone reduction and proton ejection out of the mitochondria. Mutations in this gene are associated with mitochondrial complex I deficiency. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor (NLR) family of proteins. The encoded protein plays a role in innate immunity by acting as a pattern-recognition receptor (PRR) that binds bacterial peptidoglycans and initiates inflammation. This protein has also been implicated in the immune response to viral and parasitic infection. Major structural features of this protein include an N-terminal caspase recruitment domain (CARD), a centrally located nucleotide-binding domain (NBD), and 10 tandem leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) in its C terminus. The CARD is involved in apoptotic signaling, LRRs participate in protein-protein interactions, and mutations in the NBD may affect the process of oligomerization and subsequent function of the LRR domain. Mutations in this gene are associated with asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, Behcet disease and sarcoidosis in human patients.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes neutrophil cytosolic factor 2, the 67-kilodalton cytosolic subunit of the multi-protein NADPH oxidase complex found in neutrophils. This oxidase produces a burst of superoxide which is delivered to the lumen of the neutrophil phagosome. Mutations in this gene, as well as in other NADPH oxidase subunits, can result in chronic granulomatous disease, a disease that causes recurrent infections by catalase-positive organisms. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a cytosolic regulatory component of the superoxide-producing phagocyte NADPH-oxidase, a multicomponent enzyme system important for host defense. This protein is preferentially expressed in cells of myeloid lineage. It interacts primarily with neutrophil cytosolic factor 2 (NCF2/p67-phox) to form a complex with neutrophil cytosolic factor 1 (NCF1/p47-phox), which further interacts with the small G protein RAC1 and translocates to the membrane upon cell stimulation. This complex then activates flavocytochrome b, the membrane-integrated catalytic core of the enzyme system. The PX domain of this protein can bind phospholipid products of the PI(3) kinase, which suggests its role in PI(3) kinase-mediated signaling events. The phosphorylation of this protein was found to negatively regulate the enzyme activity. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been observed.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of a large, diverse group of A-kinase anchor proteins that target the activity of protein kinase A to specific subcellular sites by binding to its type II regulatory subunits. Brain-specific expression and coat protein-like membrane recruitment of a highly similar protein in mouse suggest an involvement in neuronal post-Golgi membrane traffic. Mutations in this gene may be associated with a form of autism. This gene and its expression are frequently disrupted in patients with multiple myeloma. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms. Additional transcript variants may exist, but their full-length nature has not been determined.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the natriuretic peptide family and encodes a secreted protein which functions as a cardiac hormone. The protein undergoes two cleavage events, one within the cell and a second after secretion into the blood. The protein's biological actions include natriuresis, diuresis, vasorelaxation, inhibition of renin and aldosterone secretion, and a key role in cardiovascular homeostasis. A high concentration of this protein in the bloodstream is indicative of heart failure. The presence of myocardial injury is a significant predictor of mortality in hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, and there is evidence of increased levels of natriuretic peptide B in hospitalized non-survivor COVID-19 patients. The protein also acts as an antimicrobial peptide with antibacterial and antifungal activity. Mutations in this gene have been associated with postmenopausal osteoporosis.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is involved in several cellular processes, including centrosome duplication, protein chaperoning, and cell proliferation. The encoded phosphoprotein shuttles between the nucleolus, nucleus, and cytoplasm, chaperoning ribosomal proteins and core histones from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. This protein is also known to sequester the tumor suppressor ARF in the nucleolus, protecting it from degradation until it is needed. Mutations in this gene are associated with acute myeloid leukemia. Dozens of pseudogenes of this gene have been identified.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the family of NGFI-A binding (NAB) proteins, which function in the nucleus to repress transcription induced by some members of the EGR (early growth response) family of transactivators. NAB proteins can homo- or hetero-multimerize with other EGR or NAB proteins through a conserved N-terminal domain, and repress transcription through two partially redundant C-terminal domains. Transcriptional repression by the encoded protein is mediated in part by interactions with the nucleosome remodeling and deactylase (NuRD) complex. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described, but their biological validity has not been determined.","Variant counts

The protein functions as a ligand-dependent transcription factor that binds to mineralocorticoid response elements in order to transactivate target genes. Mutations in this gene cause autosomal dominant pseudohypoaldosteronism type I, a disorder characterized by urinary salt wasting. Defects in this gene are also associated with early onset hypertension with severe exacerbation in pregnancy. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes glucocorticoid receptor, which can function both as a transcription factor that binds to glucocorticoid response elements in the promoters of glucocorticoid responsive genes to activate their transcription, and as a regulator of other transcription factors. This receptor is typically found in the cytoplasm, but upon ligand binding, is transported into the nucleus. It is involved in inflammatory responses, cellular proliferation, and differentiation in target tissues. Mutations in this gene are associated with generalized glucocorticoid resistance. Alternative splicing of this gene results in transcript variants encoding either the same or different isoforms. Additional isoforms resulting from the use of alternate in-frame translation initiation sites have also been described, and shown to be functional, displaying diverse cytoplasm-to-nucleus trafficking patterns and distinct transcriptional activities (PMID:15866175).","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes an enzyme that localizes to the Golgi apparatus, where it transfers an acetyl group to the N-terminus of free proteins. This enzyme acts on histones, and its activity is important for chromatin assembly and chromosome integrity. Alternative splicing and the use of alternative promoters results in multiple transcript variants. The upstream promoter is located in a differentially methylated region (DMR) and undergoes imprinting; transcript variants originating from this position are expressed from the maternal allele.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the peptidase A1 family of aspartic proteases. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate an activation peptide and the mature protease. The activation peptides of aspartic proteinases function as inhibitors of the protease active site. These peptide segments, or pro-parts, are deemed important for correct folding, targeting, and control of the activation of aspartic proteinase zymogens. The encoded protease may play a role in the proteolytic processing of pulmonary surfactant protein B in the lung and may function in protein catabolism in the renal proximal tubules. This gene has been described as a marker for lung adenocarcinoma and renal cell carcinoma.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) family. This kinase is a membrane-bound receptor that, upon neurotrophin binding, phosphorylates itself and members of the MAPK pathway. Signalling through this kinase leads to cell differentiation and may play a role in the development of proprioceptive neurons that sense body position. Mutations in this gene have been associated with medulloblastomas, secretory breast carcinomas and other cancers. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the H/ACA snoRNPs (small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins) gene family. snoRNPs are involved in various aspects of rRNA processing and modification and have been classified into two families: C/D and H/ACA. The H/ACA snoRNPs also include the DKC1, NOLA1 and NOLA3 proteins. These four H/ACA snoRNP proteins localize to the dense fibrillar components of nucleoli and to coiled (Cajal) bodies in the nucleus. Both 18S rRNA production and rRNA pseudouridylation are impaired if any one of the four proteins is depleted. The four H/ACA snoRNP proteins are also components of the telomerase complex. This gene encodes a protein related to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Nhp2p. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the neuritin family, and is expressed in postmitotic-differentiating neurons of the developmental nervous system and neuronal structures associated with plasticity in the adult. The expression of this gene can be induced by neural activity and neurotrophins. The encoded protein contains a consensus cleavage signal found in glycosylphoshatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins. The encoded protein promotes neurite outgrowth and arborization, suggesting its role in promoting neuritogenesis. Overexpression of the encoded protein may be associated with astrocytoma progression. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that is an integral component of the multimeric gamma-secretase complex. The encoded protein cleaves integral membrane proteins, including Notch receptors and beta-amyloid precursor protein, and may be a stabilizing cofactor required for gamma-secretase complex assembly. The cleavage of beta-amyloid precursor protein yields amyloid beta peptide, the main component of the neuritic plaque and the hallmark lesion in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease; however, the nature of the encoded protein's role in Alzheimer's disease is not known for certain. Mutations in this gene are associated with familial acne inversa. A pseudogene of this gene is present on chromosome 21. Alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been described, but the full-length nature of some of these variants has not been determined.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of a family of E3 small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) ligases that mediates the attachment of a SUMO protein to proteins involved in nuclear transport, transcription, chromosome segregation and DNA repair. The encoded protein is part of the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) 5/6 complex which plays a key role genome maintenance, facilitating chromosome segregation and suppressing mitotic recombination. A knockout of the orthologous mouse gene is lethal prior to embryonic day 10.5. Naturally occurring mutations in this gene, that abolish the SUMO ligase activity, are associated with primordial dwarfism and extreme insulin resistance.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that is a subunit of one of the complexes that forms the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This protein is one of over 40 subunits found in complex I, the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH):ubiquinone oxidoreductase. This complex functions in the transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain, and ubiquinone is believed to be the immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme. Mutations in this gene cause Leigh syndrome due to mitochondrial complex I deficiency, a severe neurological disorder that results in bilaterally symmetrical necrotic lesions in subcortical brain regions.","Variant counts

Summary
Several proteins have been found to be prenylated and methylated at their carboxyl-terminal ends. Prenylation was initially believed to be important only for membrane attachment. However, another role for prenylation appears to be its importance in protein-protein interactions. The only nuclear proteins known to be prenylated in mammalian cells are prelamin A- and B-type lamins. Prelamin A is farnesylated and carboxymethylated on the cysteine residue of a carboxyl-terminal CaaX motif. This post-translationally modified cysteine residue is removed from prelamin A when it is endoproteolytically processed into mature lamin A. The protein encoded by this gene binds to the prenylated prelamin A carboxyl-terminal tail domain. It may be a component of a prelamin A endoprotease complex. The encoded protein is located in the nucleus, where it partially colocalizes with the nuclear lamina. It shares limited sequence similarity with iron-only bacterial hydrogenases. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified for this gene, including one with a novel exon that is generated by RNA editing.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the neuroblastoma breakpoint family (NBPF) which consists of dozens of recently duplicated genes primarily located in segmental duplications on human chromosome 1. This gene family has experienced its greatest expansion within the human lineage and has expanded, to a lesser extent, among primates in general. Members of this gene family are characterized by tandemly repeated copies of DUF1220 protein domains. DUF1220 copy number variations in human chromosomal region 1q21.1, where most DUF1220 domains are located, have been implicated in a number of developmental and neurogenetic diseases such as microcephaly, macrocephaly, autism, schizophrenia, cognitive disability, congenital heart disease, neuroblastoma, and congenital kidney and urinary tract anomalies. Altered expression of some gene family members is associated with several types of cancer. This gene family contains numerous pseudogenes.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that homodimerizes and functions as a transcription factor which activates the expression of some key metabolic genes regulating cellular growth and nuclear genes required for respiration, heme biosynthesis, and mitochondrial DNA transcription and replication. The protein has also been associated with the regulation of neurite outgrowth. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Confusion has occurred in bibliographic databases due to the shared symbol of NRF1 for this gene and for 'nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 1' which has an official symbol of NFE2L1.","Variant counts

Summary
Hydrolases are transported to lysosomes after binding to mannose 6-phosphate receptors in the trans-Golgi network. This gene encodes the enzyme that catalyzes the second step in the formation of the mannose 6-phosphate recognition marker on lysosomal hydrolases. Commonly known as 'uncovering enzyme' or UCE, this enzyme removes N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) residues from GlcNAc-alpha-P-mannose moieties and thereby produces the recognition marker. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed by furin to generate the mature enzyme, a homotetramer of two disulfide-linked homodimers. Mutations in this gene are associated with developmental stuttering in human patients.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, and is a key regulator of xenobiotic and endobiotic metabolism. The protein binds to DNA as a monomer or a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor and regulates the transcription of target genes involved in drug metabolism and bilirubin clearance, such as cytochrome P450 family members. Unlike most nuclear receptors, this transcriptional regulator is constitutively active in the absence of ligand but is regulated by both agonists and inverse agonists. Ligand binding results in translocation of this protein to the nucleus, where it activates or represses target gene transcription. These ligands include bilirubin, a variety of foreign compounds, steroid hormones, and prescription drugs. In addition to drug metabolism, the CAR protein is also reported to regulate genes involved in glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, cell proliferation, and circadian clock regulation. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

These peptides may play a role in the regulation of heart rate and blood pressure and the modulation of morphine-induced antinociception. Patients with hypertension exhibit decreased expression of the encoded protein. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, at least one of which encodes an isoform that is proteolytically processed.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a putative member of the class II family of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. These enzymes play a critical role in protein biosynthesis by charging tRNAs with their cognate amino acids. This protein is encoded by the nuclear genome but is likely to be imported to the mitochondrion where it is thought to catalyze the ligation of asparagine to tRNA molecules. Mutations in this gene have been associated with combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency 24 (COXPD24).","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is part of a 500 kb inverted duplication on chromosome 5q13. This duplicated region contains at least four genes and repetitive elements which make it prone to rearrangements and deletions. The repetitiveness and complexity of the sequence have also caused difficulty in determining the organization of this genomic region. This copy of the gene is full length; additional copies with truncations and internal deletions are also present in this region of chromosome 5q13. It is thought that this gene is a modifier of spinal muscular atrophy caused by mutations in a neighboring gene, SMN1. The protein encoded by this gene contains regions of homology to two baculovirus inhibitor of apoptosis proteins, and it is able to suppress apoptosis induced by various signals. Alternative splicing and the use of alternative promoters results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the H/ACA snoRNPs (small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins) gene family. snoRNPs are involved in various aspects of rRNA processing and modification and have been classified into two families: C/D and H/ACA. The H/ACA snoRNPs also include the DKC1, NOLA1 and NOLA2 proteins. These four H/ACA snoRNP proteins localize to the dense fibrillar components of nucleoli and to coiled (Cajal) bodies in the nucleus. Both 18S rRNA production and rRNA pseudouridylation are impaired if any one of the four proteins is depleted. The four H/ACA snoRNP proteins are also components of the telomerase complex. This gene encodes a protein related to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Nop10p.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that functions as a negative regulator of NEDD8, a ubiquitin-like protein that conjugates with cullin family members in order to regulate vital biological events. The protein encoded by this gene regulates the NEDD8 conjugation system post-transcriptionally by recruiting NEDD8 and its conjugates to the proteasome for degradation. This protein interacts with the product of the AIPL1 gene, which is associated with Leber congenital amaurosis, an inherited retinopathy, and mutations in that gene can abolish interaction with this protein, which may contribute to the pathogenesis. This protein is also known to accumulate in Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, and in glial cytoplasmic inclusions in multiple system atrophy, with this abnormal accumulation being specific to alpha-synucleinopathy lesions. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is an unusual orphan receptor that contains a putative ligand-binding domain but lacks a conventional DNA-binding domain. The gene product is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor family, a group of transcription factors regulated by small hydrophobic hormones, a subset of which do not have known ligands and are referred to as orphan nuclear receptors. The protein has been shown to interact with retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors, inhibiting their ligand-dependent transcriptional activation. In addition, interaction with estrogen receptors has been demonstrated, leading to inhibition of function. Studies suggest that the protein represses nuclear hormone receptor-mediated transactivation via two separate steps: competition with coactivators and the direct effects of its transcriptional repressor function.","Variant counts

The nuclear pore complex is a massive structure that extends across the nuclear envelope, forming a gateway that regulates the flow of macromolecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Nucleoporins, a family of 50 to 100 proteins, are the main components of the nuclear pore complex in eukaryotic cells. The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the nucleoporin family and is associated with the oncogenic nucleoporin CAN/Nup214 in a dynamic subcomplex. This protein is also overexpressed in a large number of malignant neoplasms and precancerous dysplasias. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a non-specific nucleoside triphosphatase that is slow-acting in vitro. This gene is overexpressed in many tumor tissues, and while it is not essential for the cell, overexpression is cytotoxic. However, the cytotoxicity is not related to its triphosphatase activity.","Variant counts

Summary
In yeast, over 200 protein and RNA cofactors are required for ribosome assembly, and these are generally conserved in eukaryotes. These factors orchestrate modification and cleavage of the initial 35S precursor rRNA transcript into the mature 18S, 5.8S, and 25S rRNAs, folding of the rRNA, and binding of ribosomal proteins and 5S RNA. Nob1 is involved in pre-rRNA processing. In a late cytoplasmic processing step, Nob1 cleaves a 20S rRNA intermediate at cleavage site D to produce the mature 18S rRNA (Lamanna and Karbstein, 2009 [PubMed 19706509]).","Variant counts

Summary
The mitochondrial respiratory chain provides energy to cells via oxidative phosphorylation and consists of four membrane-bound electron-transporting protein complexes (I-IV) and an ATP synthase (complex V). This gene encodes a 51 kDa subunit of the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex I; a large complex with at least 45 nuclear and mitochondrial encoded subunits that liberates electrons from NADH and channels them to ubiquinone. This subunit carries the NADH-binding site as well as flavin mononucleotide (FMN)- and Fe-S-biding sites. Defects in complex I are a common cause of mitochondrial dysfunction; a syndrome that occurs in approximately 1 in 10,000 live births. Mitochondrial complex I deficiency is linked to myopathies, encephalomyopathies, and neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Leigh syndrome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
Nucleoporins are proteins that play an important role in the assembly and functioning of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) which regulates the movement of macromolecules across the nuclear envelope (NE). The protein encoded by this gene plays a role in the fusion of NE vesicles and formation of the double membrane NE. The protein may also be involved in cardiac physiology and may be associated with the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants of this gene. A pseudogene associated with this gene is located on chromosome 6.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that is involved in the activation of the ubiquitous transcription factor NF-kappaB. This protein is associated with the the histone deacetylase HDAC3 and with the Notch corepressor complex, and it thereby acts as a transcriptional repressor of Notch target genes. It is also required for alphabeta T cell development. A related pseudogene has been identified on chromosome X, while a related and intronless retrocopy, which has an intact CDS and may be functional, is located on chromosome 6.","Variant counts

Summary
Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are used for transporting macromolecules between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. NPCs consist of multiple copies of 30 distinct proteins (nucleoporins), which assemble into biochemically-separable subcomplexes. The protein encoded by this gene is part of a subcomplex (Nup107-160) that is required for proper NPC function as well as for normal kinetochore-microtubule interaction and mitosis.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein originally thought to be related to the collagenase gene family. This gene is one of three highly similar genes in a region of duplication located on the p arm of chromosome 16. These three genes encode closely related proteins that may have the same function. The protein encoded by one of these genes has been identified as part of a protein complex that participates in the Nodal signaling pathway during vertebrate development. Mutations in ABCC6, which is located nearby, rather than mutations in this gene are associated with pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE). Two transcripts encoding different isoforms have been described.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes an L1 family immunoglobulin cell adhesion molecule with multiple IGcam and fibronectin domains. The protein functions in neurite outgrowth, neurite fasciculation, and organization of the axon initial segment (AIS) and nodes of Ranvier on axons during early development. Both the AIS and nodes of Ranvier contain high densities of voltage-gated Na+ (Nav) channels which are clustered by interactions with cytoskeletal and scaffolding proteins including this protein, gliomedin, ankyrin 3 (ankyrin-G), and betaIV spectrin. This protein links the AIS extracellular matrix to the intracellular cytoskeleton. This gene undergoes extensive alternative splicing, and the full-length nature of some variants has not been determined.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a common precursor for two peptides, neuromedin N and neurotensin. Neurotensin is a secreted tridecapeptide, which is widely distributed throughout the central nervous system, and may function as a neurotransmitter or a neuromodulator. It may be involved in dopamine-associated pathophysiological events, in the maintenance of gut structure and function, and in the regulation of fat metabolism. Neurotensin also exhibits antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi. Tissue-specific processing may lead to the formation in some tissues of larger forms of neuromedin N and neurotensin. The large forms may represent more stable peptides that are also biologically active.","Variant counts
