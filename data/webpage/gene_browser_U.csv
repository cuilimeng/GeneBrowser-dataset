Summary
This gene encodes a protein that is similar to other Ufm1-specific proteases. Studies in mouse determined that Ufsp1 releases Ufm1 (ubiquitin-fold modifier 1) from its bound conjugated complexes which also makes it into an active form. Because the human UFSP1 protein is shorter on the N-terminus and lacks a conserved Cys active site, it is predicted to be non-functional.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a highly conserved cysteine protease. The protein cleaves two C-terminal residues from ubiquitin-fold modifier 1, a ubiquitin-like post-translational modifier protein. Activation of ubiquitin-fold modifier 1 by the encoded protein exposes a C-terminal glycine residue that allows interaction with other proteins and transfer to its target protein. An allelic variant of this gene has been associated with Beukes hip dysplasia. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the transmembrane 4 superfamily, also known as the tetraspanin family. Most of these members are cell-surface proteins that are characterized by the presence of four hydrophobic domains. The proteins mediate signal transduction events that play a role in the regulation of cell development, activation, growth and motility. This encoded protein is found in the asymmetrical unit membrane (AUM) where it can complex with other transmembrane 4 superfamily proteins. It may play a role in normal bladder epithelial physiology, possibly in regulating membrane permeability of superficial umbrella cells or in stabilizing the apical membrane through AUM/cytoskeletal interactions. The protein may also play a role in tumor suppression. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants of this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the UDP-glycosyltransferase family, members of which catalyze biotransformation reactions in which lipophilic substrates are conjugated with glucuronic acid to increase water solubility and enhance excretion. They are of major importance in the conjugation and subsequent elimination of potentially toxic xenobiotics and endogenous compounds. This enzyme is expressed in the olfactory neuroepithelium, which lines the posterior nasal cavity and is exposed to a wide range of odorants and airborne toxic compounds. Hence, this protein has been suggested to be involved in clearing lipophilic odorant molecules from the sensory epithelium. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. This gene shares exon structure with the UDP glucuronosyltransferase 2A2 family member, which encodes N-terminally distinct isoforms.","Variant counts

This gene product belongs to the UNC-5 family of netrin receptors. Netrins are secreted proteins that direct axon extension and cell migration during neural development. They are bifunctional proteins that act as attractants for some cell types and as repellents for others, and these opposite actions are thought to be mediated by two classes of receptors. The UNC-5 family of receptors mediate the repellent response to netrin; they are transmembrane proteins containing 2 immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains and 2 type I thrombospondin motifs in the extracellular region.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein with a divergent C-terminal UBX domain. The homologous protein in the rat interacts with members of the Rnd subfamily of Rho GTPases at the cell periphery through its C-terminal region. It also interacts with several heterotrimeric G proteins through their G-alpha subunits and promotes Rho GTPase activation. It is proposed to serve a bidirectional role in the promotion and inhibition of Rho activity through upstream signaling pathways.

Summary
Ubiquitin is a highly conserved nuclear and cytoplasmic protein that has a major role in targeting cellular proteins for degradation by the 26S proteosome. It is also involved in the maintenance of chromatin structure, the regulation of gene expression, and the stress response. Ubiquitin is synthesized as a precursor protein consisting of either polyubiquitin chains or a single ubiquitin moiety fused to an unrelated protein. This gene encodes a fusion protein consisting of ubiquitin at the N terminus and ribosomal protein L40 at the C terminus, a C-terminal extension protein (CEP). Multiple processed pseudogenes derived from this gene are present in the genome.","Variant counts

Summary
The modification of proteins with ubiquitin is an important cellular mechanism for targeting abnormal or short-lived proteins for degradation. Ubiquitination involves at least three classes of enzymes: ubiquitin-activating enzymes, or E1s, ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, or E2s, and ubiquitin-protein ligases, or E3s. This gene encodes a member of the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme family. The encoded enzyme associates with AppBp1, an amyloid beta precursor protein binding protein, to form a heterodimer, and then the enzyme complex activates NEDD8, a ubiquitin-like protein, which regulates cell division, signaling and embryogenesis. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the ubiquitin-specific proteases (UBP) family of enzymes that cleave ubiquitin from ubiquitinated protein substrates. It is highly expressed in liver and thymus, and is localized to the nucleus. This protein efficiently cleaves only ISG15 (a ubiquitin-like protein) fusions, and deletion of this gene in mice results in a massive increase of ISG15 conjugates in tissues, indicating that this protein is a major ISG15-specific protease. Mice lacking this gene are also hypersensitive to interferon, suggesting a function of this protein in downregulating interferon responses, independent of its isopeptidase activity towards ISG15.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene appears to be involved in ubiquitination and dephosphorylation of RNA polymerase II subunits that stall after UV irradiation. The encoded protein interacts with several members of the nucleotide excision repair complex, and is thought to be involved in the transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) pathway to help remove lesions in the DNA that block transcription. Defects in this gene can cause UV-sensitive syndrome 3. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
Protein kinase CK2 is a ubiquitous and pleiotropic Ser/Thr protein kinase involved in cell growth and transformation. This gene encodes a protein similar to the E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme UBC3/CDC34. Studies suggest that CK2-dependent phosphorylation of this ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme functions by regulating beta-TrCP substrate recognition and induces its interaction with beta-TrCP, enhancing beta-catenin degradation.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene converts UDP-glucose to UDP-glucuronate and thereby participates in the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans such as hyaluronan, chondroitin sulfate, and heparan sulfate. These glycosylated compounds are common components of the extracellular matrix and likely play roles in signal transduction, cell migration, and cancer growth and metastasis. The expression of this gene is up-regulated by transforming growth factor beta and down-regulated by hypoxia. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that is part of a post-splicing multiprotein complex involved in both mRNA nuclear export and mRNA surveillance. mRNA surveillance detects exported mRNAs with truncated open reading frames and initiates nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). When translation ends upstream from the last exon-exon junction, this triggers NMD to degrade mRNAs containing premature stop codons. This protein is located only in the cytoplasm. When translation ends, it interacts with the protein that is a functional homolog of yeast Upf2p to trigger mRNA decapping. Use of multiple polyadenylation sites has been noted for this gene. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein with several conserved domains, however, its exact function is not known. Mutations in this gene are associated with poikiloderma with neutropenia (PN), which shows phenotypic overlap with Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (RTS) caused by mutations in the RECQL4 gene. It is believed that this gene product interacts with RECQL4 protein via SMAD4 proteins, explaining the partial clinical overlap between PN and RTS. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been noted for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The modification of proteins with ubiquitin is an important cellular mechanism for targeting abnormal or short-lived proteins for degradation. Ubiquitination involves at least three classes of enzymes: E1 ubiquitin-activating enzymes, E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, and E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases. This gene encodes a member of the E3 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family which accepts ubiquitin from an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and transfers the ubiquitin to the targeted substrates. A HECT (homology to E6-AP C-terminus) domain in the C-terminus of the longer isoform of this protein is the catalytic site of ubiquitin transfer and forms a complex with E2 conjugases. Shorter isoforms of this protein which lack the C-terminal HECT domain are therefore unlikely to bind E2 enzymes. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been identified for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, part of the ubiquitin protein degradation system. This imprinted gene is maternally expressed in brain and biallelically expressed in other tissues. Maternally inherited deletion of this gene causes Angelman Syndrome, characterized by severe motor and intellectual retardation, ataxia, hypotonia, epilepsy, absence of speech, and characteristic facies. The protein also interacts with the E6 protein of human papillomavirus types 16 and 18, resulting in ubiquitination and proteolysis of tumor protein p53. Alternative splicing of this gene results in three transcript variants encoding three isoforms with different N-termini. Additional transcript variants have been described, but their full length nature has not been determined.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of a subfamily of RING-finger type E3 ubiquitin ligases. The protein binds to specific DNA sequences, and recruits a histone deacetylase to regulate gene expression. Its expression peaks at late G1 phase and continues during G2 and M phases of the cell cycle. It plays a major role in the G1/S transition by regulating topoisomerase IIalpha and retinoblastoma gene expression, and functions in the p53-dependent DNA damage checkpoint. It is regarded as a hub protein for the integration of epigenetic information. This gene is up-regulated in various cancers, and it is therefore considered to be a therapeutic target. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. A related pseudogene exists on chromosome 12.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a nuclear protein which is involved in cell-cycle regulation. The encoded protein is a ubiquitin-ligase capable of ubiquinating PCNP (PEST-containing nuclear protein), and together they may play a role in tumorigenesis. The encoded protein contains an NIRF_N domain, a PHD finger, a set- and ring-associated (SRA) domain, and a RING finger domain and several of these domains have been shown to be essential for the regulation of cell proliferation. This protein may also have a role in intranuclear degradation of polyglutamine aggregates. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants some of which are non-protein coding.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of a group of proteins similar to ubiquitin. The encoded protein is not thought to degrade proteins like ubiquitin but to affect their function through being bound to target proteins by an isopeptide bond. The gene product has been studied as a link to predisposition to obesity based on its expression in Psammomys obesus, the fat sand rat, which is an animal model for obesity studies. Variation in this gene was found to be significantly associated with some metabolic traits (PMID: 15331561) but not associated with childhood obesity (PMID: 19189687). Pseudogenes of this gene are located on chromosomes 3, 5 and 17. Multiple alternatively spliced variants, encoding the same protein, have been identified.","Variant counts

Summary
Regulated degradation of misfolded, damaged or short-lived proteins in eukaryotes occurs via the ubiquitin (Ub)-proteasome system (UPS). An integral part of the UPS system is the ubiquitination of target proteins and covalent linkage of Ub-containing proteins to form polymeric chains, marking them as targets for 26S proteasome-mediated degradation. Ubiquitination of proteins is mediated by a cascade of enzymes which includes E1 (ubiquitin activating), E2 (ubiquitin conjugating), and E3 (ubiquitin ligases) enzymes. This gene encodes a member of the E2 enzyme family. Substrates of this enzyme include the tumor suppressor protein p53 and peroxisomal biogenesis factor 5 (PEX5). Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants of this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a peripheral membrane protein which recycles between the cytosol and the Golgi apparatus during interphase. It is regulated by phosphorylation: dephosphorylated protein associates with the Golgi membrane and dissociates from the membrane upon phosphorylation. Ras-associated protein 1 recruits this protein to coat protein complex II (COPII) vesicles during budding from the endoplasmic reticulum, where it interacts with a set of COPII vesicle-associated SNAREs to form a cis-SNARE complex that promotes targeting to the Golgi apparatus. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the U-box ubiquitin ligase family. The encoded protein is involved in multiubiquitin chain assembly and plays a critical role in chromosome condensation and separation through the polyubiquitination of securin. Autoantibodies against the encoded protein may be markers for scleroderma and Crohn's disease. A pseudogene of this gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 3. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein which contains two ubiquitin-like domains and appears to have similar function to ubiquitin. Through covalent attachment, the encoded protein targets other proteins for 26S proteasome degradation. This protein has been implicated to function in many cellular processes, including caspase-dependent apoptosis, formation of aggresomes, mitotic regulation, and dendritic cell maturation. Upregulation of this gene may promote inflammation in chronic kidney disease and has been observed in many cancer types.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes ubiquitin, one of the most conserved proteins known. Ubiquitin has a major role in targeting cellular proteins for degradation by the 26S proteosome. It is also involved in the maintenance of chromatin structure, the regulation of gene expression, and the stress response. Ubiquitin is synthesized as a precursor protein consisting of either polyubiquitin chains or a single ubiquitin moiety fused to an unrelated protein. This gene consists of three direct repeats of the ubiquitin coding sequence with no spacer sequence. Consequently, the protein is expressed as a polyubiquitin precursor with a final amino acid after the last repeat. An aberrant form of this protein has been detected in patients with Alzheimer's disease and Down syndrome. Pseudogenes of this gene are located on chromosomes 1, 2, 13, and 17. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that is part of a post-splicing multiprotein complex involved in both mRNA nuclear export and mRNA surveillance. The encoded protein is one of two functional homologs to yeast Upf3p. mRNA surveillance detects exported mRNAs with truncated open reading frames and initiates nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). When translation ends upstream from the last exon-exon junction, this triggers NMD to degrade mRNAs containing premature stop codons. This protein binds to the mRNA and remains bound after nuclear export, acting as a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein. It forms with Y14 a complex that binds specifically 20 nt upstream of exon-exon junctions. This gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 13. Several splice variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the deubiquitinating enzyme family. Members of this family are proteases that catalyze the removal of ubiquitin from polypeptides and are divided into five classes, depending on the mechanism of catalysis. This protein may hydrolyze the ubiquitinyl-N-epsilon amide bond of ubiquitinated proteins to regenerate ubiquitin for another catalytic cycle. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants that encode different protein isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene shares both structural and functional similarities with the dystrophin gene. It contains an actin-binding N-terminus, a triple coiled-coil repeat central region, and a C-terminus that consists of protein-protein interaction motifs which interact with dystroglycan protein components. The protein encoded by this gene is located at the neuromuscular synapse and myotendinous junctions, where it participates in post-synaptic membrane maintenance and acetylcholine receptor clustering. Mouse studies suggest that this gene may serve as a functional substitute for the dystrophin gene and therefore, may serve as a potential therapeutic alternative to muscular dystrophy which is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. Alternative splicing of the utrophin gene has been described; however, the full-length nature of these variants has not yet been determined.","Variant counts

Ubiquitination involves at least three classes of enzymes: ubiquitin-activating enzymes, ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, and ubiquitin-protein ligases. This gene encodes a member of the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family. This enzyme is required for post-replicative DNA damage repair, and may play a role in transcriptional regulation. Mutations in this gene are associated with cognitive disability. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The modification of proteins with ubiquitin is an important cellular mechanism for targeting abnormal or short-lived proteins for degradation. Ubiquitination involves at least three classes of enzymes: ubiquitin-activating enzymes, or E1s, ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, or E2s, and ubiquitin-protein ligases, or E3s. This gene encodes a member of the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family. This enzyme is required for post-replicative DNA damage repair. Its protein sequence is 100% identical to the mouse, rat, and rabbit homologs, which indicates that this enzyme is highly conserved in eukaryotic evolution.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a co-chaperone required for folding and accumulation of type II myosins. The protein consists of three tetratricopeptide repeat motifs at the N-terminus that form a complex with heat shock protein 90, a central region of unknown function that is conserved in all Unc-45 proteins, and a C-terminal Unc-45/Cro1/She4 domain. The protein is expressed at high levels in striated muscle, where its muscle myosin chaperone activity is dependent on heat shock protein 90 acting as a co-chaperone. A missense mutation in this gene has been associated with cataract development. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzyme variant proteins constitute a distinct subfamily within the E2 protein family. They have sequence similarity to other ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes but lack the conserved cysteine residue that is critical for the catalytic activity of E2s. The protein encoded by this gene is located in the nucleus and can cause transcriptional activation of the human FOS proto-oncogene. It is thought to be involved in the control of differentiation by altering cell cycle behavior. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been described for this gene, and multiple pseudogenes of this gene have been identified. Co-transcription of this gene and the neighboring upstream gene generates a rare transcript (Kua-UEV), which encodes a fusion protein comprised of sequence sharing identity with each individual gene product.","Variant counts

The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate the mature peptide hormone, which is secreted by pancreatic beta and alpha cells. This hormone is an endogenous ligand for corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 2 and may regulate insulin secretion in response to plasma glucose levels. Patients with type 2 diabetes exhibit reduced levels of the encoded protein in beta cells. In the brain, the encoded protein may be responsible for the effects of stress on appetite.","Variant counts

Summary
Mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCP) are members of the family of mitochondrial anion carrier proteins (MACP). UCPs separate oxidative phosphorylation from ATP synthesis with energy dissipated as heat, also referred to as the mitochondrial proton leak. UCPs facilitate the transfer of anions from the inner to the outer mitochondrial membrane and the return transfer of protons from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane. They also reduce the mitochondrial membrane potential in mammalian cells. Tissue specificity occurs for the different UCPs and the exact methods of how UCPs transfer H+/OH- are not known. UCPs contain the three homologous protein domains of MACPs. This gene is expressed only in brown adipose tissue, a specialized tissue which functions to produce heat.","Variant counts

Summary
Mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCP) are members of the larger family of mitochondrial anion carrier proteins (MACP). UCPs separate oxidative phosphorylation from ATP synthesis with energy dissipated as heat, also referred to as the mitochondrial proton leak. UCPs facilitate the transfer of anions from the inner to the outer mitochondrial membrane and the return transfer of protons from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane. They also reduce the mitochondrial membrane potential in mammalian cells. The different UCPs have tissue-specific expression; this gene is primarily expressed in skeletal muscle. This gene's protein product is postulated to protect mitochondria against lipid-induced oxidative stress. Expression levels of this gene increase when fatty acid supplies to mitochondria exceed their oxidation capacity and the protein enables the export of fatty acids from mitochondria. UCPs contain the three solcar protein domains typically found in MACPs. Two splice variants have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is the most abundant protein in mammalian urine under physiological conditions. Its excretion in urine follows proteolytic cleavage of the ectodomain of its glycosyl phosphatidylinosital-anchored counterpart that is situated on the luminal cell surface of the loop of Henle. This protein may act as a constitutive inhibitor of calcium crystallization in renal fluids. Excretion of this protein in urine may provide defense against urinary tract infections caused by uropathogenic bacteria. Defects in this gene are associated with the renal disorders medullary cystic kidney disease-2 (MCKD2), glomerulocystic kidney disease with hyperuricemia and isosthenuria (GCKDHI), and familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy (FJHN). Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that belongs to the CN hydrolase family. Beta-ureidopropionase catalyzes the last step in the pyrimidine degradation pathway. The pyrimidine bases uracil and thymine are degraded via the consecutive action of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DHPDH), dihydropyrimidinase (DHP) and beta-ureidopropionase (UP) to beta-alanine and beta-aminoisobutyric acid, respectively. UP deficiencies are associated with N-carbamyl-beta-amino aciduria and may lead to abnormalities in neurological activity.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that is a member of the UNC13 family, containing similar domain structure as other family members but lacking an N-terminal phorbol ester-binding C1 domain present in other Munc13 proteins. The protein appears to play a role in vesicle maturation during exocytosis and is involved in regulation of cytolytic granules secretion. Mutations in this gene are associated with familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis type 3, a genetically heterogeneous, rare autosomal recessive disorder.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is expressed in the kidney cortical epithelial cells and is upregulated by hyperglycemia. The encoded protein shares a high level of similarity to the rat homolog, and contains 3 C2 domains and a diacylglycerol-binding C1 domain. Hyperglycemia increases the levels of diacylglycerol, which has been shown to induce apoptosis in cells transfected with this gene and thus contribute to the renal cell complications of hyperglycemia. Studies in other species also indicate a role for this protein in the priming step of synaptic vesicle exocytosis.","Variant counts

Summary
The enzyme encoded by this gene is an important intermediary in mammalian carbohydrate interconversions. It transfers a glucose moiety from glucose-1-phosphate to MgUTP and forms UDP-glucose and MgPPi. In liver and muscle tissue, UDP-glucose is a direct precursor of glycogen; in lactating mammary gland it is converted to UDP-galactose which is then converted to lactose. The eukaryotic enzyme has no significant sequence similarity to the prokaryotic enzyme. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, an enzyme of the glucuronidation pathway that transforms small lipophilic molecules, such as steroids, bilirubin, hormones, and drugs, into water-soluble, excretable metabolites. This gene is part of a complex locus that encodes several UDP-glucuronosyltransferases. The locus includes thirteen unique alternate first exons followed by four common exons. Four of the alternate first exons are considered pseudogenes. Each of the remaining nine 5' exons may be spliced to the four common exons, resulting in nine proteins with different N-termini and identical C-termini. Each first exon encodes the substrate binding site, and is regulated by its own promoter. The enzyme encoded by this gene has glucuronidase activity with many substrates including coumarins, phenols, anthraquinones, flavones, and some opioids.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, an enzyme of the glucuronidation pathway that transforms small lipophilic molecules, such as steroids, bilirubin, hormones, and drugs, into water-soluble, excretable metabolites. This gene is part of a complex locus that encodes several UDP-glucuronosyltransferases. The locus includes thirteen unique alternate first exons followed by four common exons. Four of the alternate first exons are considered pseudogenes. Each of the remaining nine 5' exons may be spliced to the four common exons, resulting in nine proteins with different N-termini and identical C-termini. Each first exon encodes the substrate binding site, and is regulated by its own promoter. The enzyme encoded by this gene is active on phenols.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a uridine 5'-monophosphate synthase. The encoded protein is a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the final two steps of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. The first reaction is carried out by the N-terminal enzyme orotate phosphoribosyltransferase which converts orotic acid to orotidine-5'-monophosphate. The terminal reaction is carried out by the C-terminal enzyme OMP decarboxylase which converts orotidine-5'-monophosphate to uridine monophosphate. Defects in this gene are the cause of hereditary orotic aciduria. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a uridine kinase. Uridine kinases catalyze the phosphorylation of uridine to uridine monophosphate. This protein has been shown to bind to Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 3 as well as natural killer lytic-associated molecule. Ubiquitination of this protein is enhanced by the presence of natural killer lytic-associated molecule. In addition, protein levels decrease in the presence of natural killer lytic-associated molecule, suggesting that association with natural killer lytic-associated molecule results in ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of this protein. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
Ubiquitin (MIM 191339) is a highly conserved 76-amino acid protein involved in regulation of intracellular protein breakdown, cell cycle regulation, and stress response. Ubiquitin is released from degraded proteins by disassembly of the polyubiquitin chains, which is mediated by ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs), such as USP25 (Valero et al., 1999 [PubMed 10644437]).","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the C19 peptidase family, also known as family 2 of ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolases. The encoded protein cleaves ubiquitin from ubiquitinated proteins for recycling in intracellular protein degradation. The encoded protein is also able to release NEDD8, a ubiquitin-like protein, from NEDD8-conjugated proteins. This gene has been referred to as USP16 and USP23 but is now known as USP21. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a ubiquitin specific processing protease that was first identified as a substrate of the VHL (von Hippel-Lindau disease) protein E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. In addition to being ubiquitinated by the VHL-E3 ligase complex, this enzyme deubiquitinates hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 alpha and thereby causes increased expression of HIF-1alpha targeted genes which play a role in angiogenesis, glucose metabolism, cell proliferation and metastasis. The enzyme encoded by this gene also regulates G-protein coupled receptor signaling by mediating the deubiquitination of beta-2 adrenergic receptor (ADRB2). This enzyme is a ubiquitously expressed thiolester hydrolase. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding the same protein.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a member of the sauvagine/corticotropin-releasing factor/urotensin I family. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate the mature peptide, an endogenous ligand for both corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1 and corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 2. In the brain this peptide may be responsible for the effects of stress on appetite. This peptide may also play a role in mood disorders, neurodegeneration, and skeletal system disorders. In spite of the gene family name similarity, the product of this gene has no sequence similarity to urotensin-2.","Variant counts

Summary
Mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCP) are members of the larger family of mitochondrial anion carrier proteins (MACP). UCPs separate oxidative phosphorylation from ATP synthesis with energy dissipated as heat, also referred to as the mitochondrial proton leak. UCPs facilitate the transfer of anions from the inner to the outer mitochondrial membrane and the return transfer of protons from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane. They also reduce the mitochondrial membrane potential in mammalian cells. Tissue specificity occurs for the different UCPs and the exact methods of how UCPs transfer H+/OH- are not known. UCPs contain the three homologous protein domains of MACPs. This gene is expressed in many tissues, with the greatest expression in skeletal muscle. It is thought to play a role in nonshivering thermogenesis, obesity and diabetes. Chromosomal order is 5'-UCP3-UCP2-3'.","Variant counts

U2 auxiliary factor (U2AF), comprised of a large and a small subunit, is a non-snRNP protein required for the binding of U2 snRNP to the pre-mRNA branch site. This gene encodes the U2AF large subunit which contains a sequence-specific RNA-binding region with 3 RNA recognition motifs and an Arg/Ser-rich domain necessary for splicing. The large subunit binds to the polypyrimidine tract of introns early during spliceosome assembly. Multiple transcript variants have been detected for this gene, but the full-length natures of only two have been determined to date.","Variant counts

This gene is a member of the UBA domain family, whose members include proteins having connections to ubiquitin and the ubiquitination pathway. The ubiquitin associated domain is thought to be a non-covalent ubiquitin binding domain consisting of a compact three helix bundle. This particular protein originates from a gene locus in a refined region on chromosome 9 undergoing loss of heterozygosity in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Taking into account its cytogenetic location, this UBA domain family member is being studies as a putative target for mutation in nasopharyngeal carcinomas. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes one of several uracil-DNA glycosylases. One important function of uracil-DNA glycosylases is to prevent mutagenesis by eliminating uracil from DNA molecules by cleaving the N-glycosylic bond and initiating the base-excision repair (BER) pathway. Uracil bases occur from cytosine deamination or misincorporation of dUMP residues. Alternative promoter usage and splicing of this gene leads to two different isoforms: the mitochondrial UNG1 and the nuclear UNG2. The UNG2 term was used as a previous symbol for the CCNO gene (GeneID 10309), which has been confused with this gene, in the literature and some databases.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-related molecule that binds to the NKG2D receptor on natural killer (NK) cells to trigger release of multiple cytokines and chemokines that in turn contribute to the recruitment and activation of NK cells. The encoded protein undergoes further processing to generate the mature protein that is either anchored to membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol moiety, or secreted. Many malignant cells secrete the encoded protein to evade immunosurveillance by NK cells. This gene is located in a cluster of multiple MHC class I-related genes on chromosome 6.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that contains ankyrin repeats and coiled coil domains and likely plays a role in apoptosis. Studies in rodents have implicated the encoded protein in the stimulation of apoptosis and the regulation of mammary gland involution, in which the mammary gland returns to its pre-pregnant state. This protein has also been proposed to negatively regulate apoptosis based on experiments in human cell lines in which the protein was shown to interact with PRKC apoptosis WT1 regulator protein, also known as PAR-4, and inhibit translocation of the PAR-4 receptor.

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the uridine diphosphoglucuronosyltransferase protein family. The encoded enzyme catalyzes the transfer of glucuronic acid from uridine diphosphoglucuronic acid to a diverse array of substrates including steroid hormones and lipid-soluble drugs. This process, known as glucuronidation, is an intermediate step in the metabolism of steroids. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. While both isoforms are targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum, only the longer isoform appears to be active.","Variant counts

Summary
p97 or VCP (valosin-containing protein) is a versatile ATPase complex, and many cofactors are required for the p97 functional diversity. This gene encodes one of the p97 cofactors. This cofactor is a transmembrane protein and localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. It tethers p97 to the ER membrane via its UBX domain. The association of this cofactor with p97 facilitates efficient ER-associated degradation of misfolded proteins. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the UDP-glycosyltransferase (UGT) family. UGTs serve a major role in the conjugation and subsequent elimination of potentially toxic xenobiotics and endogenous compounds. This protein is localized in the microsome membrane, and has unique specificity for 3,4-catechol estrogens and estriol, suggesting that it may play an important role in regulating the level and activity of these potent estrogen metabolites. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein containing domains that associate it with the peptidase family C19, also known as family 2 of ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolases. Family members function as deubiquitinating enzymes, recognizing and hydrolyzing the peptide bond at the C-terminal glycine of ubiquitin. Enzymes in peptidase family C19 are involved in the processing of poly-ubiquitin precursors as well as that of ubiquitinated proteins. Alternate transcriptional splice variants, encoding different isoforms, have been characterized.","Variant counts

Summary
Ubiquitin (see MIM 191339)-dependent proteolysis is a complex pathway of protein metabolism implicated in such diverse cellular functions as maintenance of chromatin structure, receptor function, and degradation of abnormal proteins. A late step of the process involves disassembly of the polyubiquitin chains on degraded proteins into ubiquitin monomers. USP5 disassembles branched polyubiquitin chains by a sequential exo mechanism, starting at the proximal end of the chain (Wilkinson et al., 1995 [PubMed 7578059]).","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, an enzyme of the glucuronidation pathway that transforms small lipophilic molecules, such as steroids, bilirubin, hormones, and drugs, into water-soluble, excretable metabolites. This gene is part of a complex locus that encodes several UDP-glucuronosyltransferases. The locus includes thirteen unique alternate first exons followed by four common exons. Four of the alternate first exons are considered pseudogenes. Each of the remaining nine 5' exons may be spliced to the four common exons, resulting in nine proteins with different N-termini and identical C-termini. Each first exon encodes the substrate binding site, and is regulated by its own promoter. The enzyme encoded by this gene has glucuronidase activity on mycophenolic acid, coumarins, and quinolines.","Variant counts

Summary
The modification of proteins with ubiquitin is an important cellular mechanism for targeting abnormal or short-lived proteins for degradation. Ubiquitination involves at least three classes of enzymes: ubiquitin-activating enzymes, or E1s, ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, or E2s, and ubiquitin-protein ligases, or E3s. This gene encodes an additional conjugation factor, E4, which is involved in multiubiquitin chain assembly. This gene is also the strongest candidate in the neuroblastoma tumor suppressor genes. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that belongs to the ubiquitin-specific processing protease family of proteins. The encoded protein is thought to regulate the morphology of the endosome by ubiquitination of proteins on this organelle and is involved in cargo sorting and membrane trafficking at the early endosome stage. This protein is required for the cell to enter the S phase of the cell cycle and also functions as a positive regulator in the Hedgehog signaling pathway in development. Pseudogenes of this gene are present on chromosomes 2 and 6. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the ubiquitin-specific processing (UBP) family of proteases that is a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) with His and Cys domains. This protein is located in the cytoplasm and cleaves the ubiquitin moiety from ubiquitin-fused precursors and ubiquitinylated proteins. The protein specifically deubiquitinates a protein in the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway. Alternate transcriptional splice variants have been characterized.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the family of de-ubiquitinating enzymes, which belongs to the peptidase C19 superfamily. The encoded protein is a ubiquitin-specific protease which is required for TNF-alpha (tumor necrosis factor alpha) -induced NF-kB (nuclear factor kB) signaling. This protein deubiquitinates polyubiquitinated target proteins such as fatty acid synthase, murine double minute 2 (MDM2), MDM4/MDMX and cyclin D1. MDM2 and MDM4 are negative regulators of the p53 tumor suppressor and cyclin D1 is required for cell cycle G1/S transition. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the peptidase C19 family, which includes ubiquitinyl hydrolases. This protein deubiquitinates target proteins such as p53 (a tumor suppressor protein) and WASH (essential for endosomal protein recycling), and regulates their activities by counteracting the opposing ubiquitin ligase activity of proteins such as HDM2 and TRIM27, involved in the respective process. Mutations in this gene have been implicated in a neurodevelopmental disorder.","Variant counts
