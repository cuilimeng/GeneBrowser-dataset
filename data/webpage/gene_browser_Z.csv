Summary
This gene encodes a C2H2-type zinc finger protein, which may function as a transcription factor. This gene also contains long CAG trinucleotide repeats that encode consecutive glutamine residues. The protein appears to bind and regulate the promoters of the extracellular matrix genes MMP1, MMP3, MMP7 and COL1A1. Studies in mouse suggest that nuclear matrix transcription factors (NP/NMP4) may be part of a general mechanical pathway that couples cell construction and function during extracellular matrix remodeling. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Recurrent rearrangements of this gene with the Ewing's sarcoma gene, EWSR1 on chromosome 22, or with the TAF15 gene on chromosome 17, or with the TCF3 (E2A) gene on chromosome 19, have been observed in acute leukemia. A related pseudogene has been identified on chromosome 7.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a transcription factor with multiple homeodomains and zinc finger motifs, and regulates myogenic and neuronal differentiation. The encoded protein suppresses expression of the alpha-fetoprotein gene by binding to an AT-rich enhancer motif. The protein has also been shown to negatively regulate c-Myb, and transactivate the cell cycle inhibitor cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (also known as p21CIP1). This gene is reported to function as a tumor suppressor in several cancers, and sequence variants of this gene are also associated with atrial fibrillation. Multiple transcript variants expressed from alternate promoters and encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the zinc finger family of proteins. The gene product contains C2H2-type domains, which are the classical zinc finger domains found in numerous nucleic acid-binding proteins. This protein functions as a regulator of the non-canonical NF-kappaB pathway in lymphotoxin-beta receptor signaling. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. A read-through transcript variant composed of ZFP91 and the downstream CNTF gene sequence has been identified, but it is thought to be non-coding. Read-through transcription of ZFP91 and CNTF has also been observed in mouse. A ZFP91-related pseudogene has also been identified on chromosome 2.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene appears to represent an intronless retrocopy of a related multi-exon gene located on chromosome 3. However, the CDS of this intronless gene remains relatively intact, it is conserved in other mammalian species, it is known to be transcribed, and it is therefore thought to encode a functional protein. The encoded protein contains six CCHC-type zinc fingers, and is thus thought to function as a transcription factor.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the Kruppel family of zinc finger DNA binding proteins. The encoded protein activates transcription of the T-cell receptor and intestinal alkaline phosphatase genes but represses transcription of the ornithine decarboxylase, vimentin, gastrin, stomelysin, and enolase genes. Increased expression of this gene results in decreased patient survival rates from colorectal cancer, while mutations in this gene have been associated with global developmental delay, hypoplastic corpus callosum, and dysmorphic facies.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes an F-box-containing protein that is a component of an SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that regulates the onset of cell division. The G2/M transition in the cell cycle requires the interaction of the proteins cyclin B1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 1. The activated ubiquitin ligase complex targets the protein cyclin B1 for degradation, preventing this transition to mitosis.","Variant counts

Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) can be reactivated from latency by the viral protein RTA. The protein encoded by this gene is a zinc finger transcriptional repressor that interacts with RTA to modulate RTA-mediated reactivation of KSHV. While the encoded protein can repress KSHV reactivation, RTA can induce degradation of this protein through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway to overcome the repression. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a nuclear protein that belongs to the family of Kruppel-like C2H2 zinc finger proteins. It functions as a DNA-binding transcription factor by using distinct zinc fingers in different signaling pathways. Thus, it is thought that this gene may have multiple roles in signal transduction during development. Mutations in this gene are associated with nephronophthisis-14 and Joubert syndrome-19. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The zinc finger protein encoded by this gene is a widely expressed member of the FOG family of transcription factors. The family members modulate the activity of GATA family proteins, which are important regulators of hematopoiesis and cardiogenesis in mammals. It has been demonstrated that the protein can both activate and down-regulate expression of GATA-target genes, suggesting different modulation in different promoter contexts. A related mRNA suggests an alternatively spliced product but this information is not yet fully supported by the sequence.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the PIAS (protein inhibitor of activated STAT) family of proteins. The encoded protein regulates the activity of various transcription factors, including the androgen receptor, Smad3/4, and p53. The encoded protein may also play a role in sumoylation. A translocation between this locus on chromosome 10 and the protein tyrosine kinase ABL1 locus on chromosome 9 has been associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that plays a role in neural-cell differentiation. Overexpression of this gene causes neurite-like elongation. The encoded protein contains both a zinc finger and a RING finger motif and is localized in the endosome/lysosome compartment, indicating that it may be involved in ubiquitin-mediated protein modification, and in synaptic vessicle membranes in neurons.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene contains several copies of zinc finger motif, which is commonly found in transcriptional regulatory proteins. Studies in mice show that this gene is expressed during embryonic development, and specifically in the testis in adult mice, suggesting that it may play a role in regulating genes in germ cells. Alternative splicing of this gene results in several transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
The zona pellucida is an extracellular matrix that surrounds the oocyte and early embryo. It is composed primarily of three or four glycoproteins with various functions during fertilization and preimplantation development. The protein encoded by this gene is a structural component of the zona pellucida and functions in primary binding and induction of the sperm acrosome reaction. The nascent protein contains a N-terminal signal peptide sequence, a conserved ZP domain, a C-terminal consensus furin cleavage site, and a transmembrane domain. It is hypothesized that furin cleavage results in release of the mature protein from the plasma membrane for subsequent incorporation into the zona pellucida matrix. However, the requirement for furin cleavage in this process remains controversial based on mouse studies. A variation in the last exon of this gene has previously served as the basis for an additional ZP3 locus; however, sequence and literature review reveals that there is only one full-length ZP3 locus in the human genome. Another locus encoding a bipartite transcript designated POMZP3 contains a duplication of the last four exons of ZP3, including the above described variation, and maps closely to this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The zona pellucida is an extracellular matrix that surrounds the oocyte and early embryo. It is composed of three glycoproteins with various functions during fertilization and preimplantation development. The glycosylated mature peptide is one of the structural components of the zona pellucida and functions in secondary binding and penetration of acrosome-reacted spermatozoa. Female mice lacking this gene do not form a stable zona matrix and are sterile. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

This encoded protein may function as a transcription factor that regulates the expression of GABA type-A receptors in the brain. Transcripts from this gene have been shown to form stable and abundant circular RNAs. Elevated expression of this gene has been observed in gastric cancer and the encoded protein may stimulate migration and invasion of human gastric cancer cells.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that is clearly involved in kinetochore function although an exact role is not known. It interacts with ZW10, another kinetochore protein, possibly regulating the association between ZW10 and kinetochores. The encoded protein localizes to prophase kinetochores before ZW10 does and it remains detectable on the kinetochore until late anaphase. It has a uniform distribution in the cytoplasm of interphase cells. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is located in the pseudoautosomal region 1 (PAR1) of X and Y chromosomes. It was earlier identified as a gene with similarity to Ac transposable elements, however, was found not to have transposase activity. Later studies show that this gene product is localized in the nucleus and functions as a transcription factor. It binds to DNA elements found in the promoter regions of several genes related to cell proliferation, such as histone H1, hence may have a role in regulating genes related to cell proliferation. Alternatively spliced transcript variants with different 5' untranslated region have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein with two C2H2 zinc finger motifs and a score-and-three (23)-amino acid peptide repeat (STPR) domain. The STPR domain of the encoded protein binds to double stranded DNA and may also contain a nuclear localization signal, suggesting that this protein interacts with chromosomal DNA. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene on the X chromosome is structurally similar to a related gene on the Y chromosome. It encodes a member of the krueppel C2H2-type zinc-finger protein family. The full-length protein contains an acidic transcriptional activation domain (AD), a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) and a DNA binding domain (DBD) consisting of 13 C2H2-type zinc fingers. Studies in mouse embryonic and adult hematopoietic stem cells showed that this gene was required as a transcriptional regulator for self-renewal of both stem cell types, but it was dispensable for growth and differentiation of their progeny. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified, but the full-length nature of some variants has not been determined.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes an RNA-binding protein characterized by its DZF (domain associated with zinc fingers) domain. The encoded protein may play a role in the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of another RNA-binding protein, Staufen homolog 2, in neurons. Expression of this gene is regulated through alternative polyadenylation that mediates differential microRNA targeting. Elevated expression of this gene has been observed in human patients with pancreatic cancer and knockdown of this gene may result in reduced viability and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a Kruppel-related zinc finger protein which is characterized by the presence of an N-terminal repressor domain, the Kruppel-associated box (KRAB). The KRAB domain is a potent repressor of transcription; thus this protein may function in transcription regulation. Multiple transcript variants have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes an enzyme belonging to the protein tyrosine kinase family, and it plays a role in T-cell development and lymphocyte activation. This enzyme, which is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues upon T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) stimulation, functions in the initial step of TCR-mediated signal transduction in combination with the Src family kinases, Lck and Fyn. This enzyme is also essential for thymocyte development. Mutations in this gene cause selective T-cell defect, a severe combined immunodeficiency disease characterized by a selective absence of CD8-positive T-cells. Two transcript variants that encode different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the TIS11 family of early response genes, which are induced by various agonists such as the phorbol ester TPA and the polypeptide mitogen EGF. This gene is well conserved across species and has a promoter that contains motifs seen in other early-response genes. The encoded protein contains a distinguishing putative zinc finger domain with a repeating cys-his motif. This putative nuclear transcription factor most likely functions in regulating the response to growth factors. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a nucleolar, zinc finger protein that preferentially binds to double-stranded (ds) RNA or RNA/DNA hybrids, rather than DNA alone. Mutational studies indicate that the zinc finger domains are not only essential for dsRNA binding, but are also required for its nucleolar localization. The encoded protein may be involved in cell growth and survival. It plays a role in protecting neurons by inhibiting cell cycle re-entry via stimulation of p21 gene expression. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a transcriptional regulator with bimodal DNA-binding specificity, which binds to methylated CGCG and also to the non-methylated consensus KAISO-binding site TCCTGCNA. The protein contains an N-terminal POZ/BTB domain and 3 C-terminal zinc finger motifs. It recruits the N-CoR repressor complex to promote histone deacetylation and the formation of repressive chromatin structures in target gene promoters. It may contribute to the repression of target genes of the Wnt signaling pathway, and may also activate transcription of a subset of target genes by the recruitment of catenin delta-2 (CTNND2). Its interaction with catenin delta-1 (CTNND1) inhibits binding to both methylated and non-methylated DNA. It also interacts directly with the nuclear import receptor Importin-alpha2 (also known as karyopherin alpha2 or RAG cohort 1), which may mediate nuclear import of this protein. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein have been identified.","Variant counts

Kruppel-like zinc finger proteins such as ZNF189 contain a conserved stretch of 7 amino acids that connects a variable number of DNA-binding zinc finger repeats of the cys(2)his(2) (C2H2) type (summarized by Odeberg et al., 1998 [PubMed 9653648]). Approximately 30% of human Kruppel-like zinc finger proteins contain an N-terminal Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain. The KRAB domain consists of approximately 75 amino acids that may be subdivided into an A box, which is present in every KRAB domain and is essential for transcriptional repression, and a B box, which is not always present.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene contains C2H2 zinc finger domains. In some individuals, a CGG-repeat expansion from 5-22 repeats to 68-450 repeats has been identified in the first intron of this gene. This mutation is thought to effect the expression of this gene and it has been proposed that it may be associated with Autistic Spectrum Disorder.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the C2H2 zinc finger protein family. This protein is predicted to have a pox virus and zinc finger (POZ) domain at the N-terminus and four zinc finger domains at the C-terminus. In human and mouse, the protein localizes to the nuclei of skeletal muscle cells. Knockdown of this gene in zebrafish results in abnormal skeletal muscle development and myofibrillar disorganization. A novel homozygous variant of the human gene has been associated with lethal congenital contracture syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder that results in muscle wasting.","Variant counts

Summary
Zinc finger proteins (ZNFs), such as ZNF208, bind DNA and, through this binding, regulate gene transcription. Most ZNFs contain conserved C2H2 motifs and are classified as Kruppel-type zinc fingers. A conserved protein motif, termed the Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain, mediates protein-protein interactions (Eichler et al., 1998 [PubMed 9724325]). See ZNF91 (MIM 603971) for further information on ZNFs.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a double zinc finger motif-containing protein that participates in the transforming growth factor-beta (TGFB) signalling pathway. The encoded protein interacts directly with SMAD2 and SMAD3, and recruits SMAD2 to the TGFB receptor. There are multiple pseudogenes for this gene on chromosomes 2, 15, and X. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The FYVE domain mediates the recruitment of proteins involved in membrane trafficking and cell signaling to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate-containing membranes. This protein contains two zinc-binding FYVE domains in tandem and is reported to localize to the Golgi apparatus. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a scaffold protein which serves as an assessory factor to the nuclear RNA exosome complex. The encoded protein forms a trimeric human nuclear exosome targeting (NEXT) complex, together with hMTR4 and the RNA-binding factor RBM7 which promotes the exosomal degradation of non-coding promoter-upstream transcripts, enhancer RNAs and 3'-extended products of histone- and small nuclear RNA transcription. This complex is also thought to recruit the exosome to degrade intronic RNAs via its interaction with both the exosome and the spliceosome. It contains both an N-terminal zinc-knuckle domain and a C-terminal proline-rich domain.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the Krueppel C2H2-type zinc-finger protein family and encodes a zinc finger transcription factor that contains nine Kruppel-type zinc finger domains at the carboxyl terminus. This protein is located in the nucleus, is involved in cell cycle progression, and interacts with a histone deacetylase. Specific instances of aberrant gene rearrangement at this locus have been associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Alternate transcriptional splice variants have been characterized.","Variant counts

This protein functions as a transcriptional repressor and may regulate tissue specific expression of dopamine receptor D1. Expansion of an alanine repeat in the C-terminus of the encoded protein and other mutations in this gene cause holoprosencephaly type 5. Holoprosencephaly is the most common structural anomaly of the human brain. A polyhistidine tract polymorphism in this gene may be associated with increased risk of neural tube defects.

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a receptor for activated C-kinase (RACK) protein. The encoded protein has been shown to bind in vitro to activated protein kinase C beta I. In addition, this protein is a cutaneous T-cell lymphoma-associated antigen. Finally, the protein contains a bromodomain and two zinc fingers, and is thought to be a transcriptional regulator. Multiple transcript variants encoding several different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Focal adhesions are actin-rich structures that enable cells to adhere to the extracellular matrix and at which protein complexes involved in signal transduction assemble. Zyxin is a zinc-binding phosphoprotein that concentrates at focal adhesions and along the actin cytoskeleton. Zyxin has an N-terminal proline-rich domain and three LIM domains in its C-terminal half. The proline-rich domain may interact with SH3 domains of proteins involved in signal transduction pathways while the LIM domains are likely involved in protein-protein binding. Zyxin may function as a messenger in the signal transduction pathway that mediates adhesion-stimulated changes in gene expression and may modulate the cytoskeletal organization of actin bundles. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants that encode the same isoform.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene, which was initially designated as dendritic cell-derived BTB/POZ zinc finger (DPZF), belongs to a family of transcription factors with an N-terminal BTB/POZ domain and a C-terminal DNA-bindng zinc finger domain. The BTB/POZ domain is a hydrophobic region of approximately 120 aa which mediates association with other BTB/POZ domain-containing proteins. This gene acts as a transcriptional repressor and plays a role in many processes including neurogenesis, glucose homeostasis, and postnatal growth. Mutations in this gene have been associated with Primrose syndrome as well as the 3q13.31 microdeletion syndrome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a zinc finger protein containing a Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain at its N-terminus, followed by contiguous C2H2 zinc finger motifs. The encoded protein is a nuclear protein that can act as a transcriptional repressor of growth factor-mediated signaling pathways in a reporter gene assay. This protein has been shown to interact with the SRY-box 9 gene product, and suppresses its transcriptional activity by inhibiting its DNA binding activity. Reduced expression of this gene promotes chondrocyte differentiation. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is found in the cytoplasm of quiescent cells but translocates to the nucleolus in proliferating cells. The encoded protein interacts with survival motor neuron protein (SMN1) to enhance pre-mRNA splicing and to induce neuronal differentiation and axonal growth. Defects in this gene or the SMN1 gene can cause spinal muscular atrophy. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a zinc finger protein that may act as a transcription factor. The encoded protein may be part of a BHC histone deacetylase complex. Translocation of this gene with the fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 gene (FGFR1) results in a fusion gene, which may be a cause of stem cell leukemia lymphoma syndrome (SCLL). Several transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is located on the X chromosome and is subject to X inactivation. It is highly conserved in vertebrates and most abundantly expressed in the brain. The encoded protein is a component of histone deacetylase-containing multiprotein complexes that function through modifying chromatin structure to keep genes silent. A chromosomal translocation (X;13) involving this gene is associated with X-linked cognitive disability. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Pre-mRNA splicing is catalyzed by the spliceosome. U12-type spliceosome binds U12-type pre-mRNAs and recognizes the 5' splice site and branch-point sequence. U11 and U12 snRNPs are components of U12-type spliceosome and function as a molecular bridge connecting both ends of the intron. The protein encoded by this gene contains a RNA recognition motif. It was identified as one of the protein components of U11/U12 snRNPs. This protein and many other U11/U12 snRNP proteins are highly conserved in organisms known to contain U12-type introns. These proteins have been shown to be essential for cell viability, suggesting the key roles in U12-type splicing.","Variant counts
