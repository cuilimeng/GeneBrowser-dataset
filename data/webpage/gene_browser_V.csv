Summary
This gene encodes a transmembrane protein that plays a key regulatory role in the process of autophagy. The ectopic overexpression of the encoded protein in cultured cells triggers autophagy even under nutrient-rich conditions. This gene is overexpressed in pancreatitis affected acinar cells where the encoded protein mediates sequestration and degradation of potentially deleterious activated zymogen granules in a process termed, zymophagy.","Variant counts

This gene is a member of the VAV gene family. The VAV proteins are guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for Rho family GTPases that activate pathways leading to actin cytoskeletal rearrangements and transcriptional alterations. The encoded protein is important in hematopoiesis, playing a role in T-cell and B-cell development and activation. The encoded protein has been identified as the specific binding partner of Nef proteins from HIV-1. Coexpression and binding of these partners initiates profound morphological changes, cytoskeletal rearrangements and the JNK/SAPK signaling cascade, leading to increased levels of viral transcription and replication. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the family of soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein-attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) that function in intracellular trafficking. This family member is involved in vesicular transport between endosomes and the trans-Golgi network. It is a vesicle-associated SNARE (v-SNARE) that interacts with target membrane SNAREs (t-SNAREs). Polymorphisms in this gene have been associated with binocular function, and also with susceptibility to colorectal and lung cancers. A recurrent rearrangement has been found between this gene and the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene in colorectal cancers. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL) is a dominantly inherited familial cancer syndrome predisposing to a variety of malignant and benign tumors. A germline mutation of this gene is the basis of familial inheritance of VHL syndrome. The protein encoded by this gene is a component of the protein complex that includes elongin B, elongin C, and cullin-2, and possesses ubiquitin ligase E3 activity. This protein is involved in the ubiquitination and degradation of hypoxia-inducible-factor (HIF), which is a transcription factor that plays a central role in the regulation of gene expression by oxygen. RNA polymerase II subunit POLR2G/RPB7 is also reported to be a target of this protein. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been observed.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene belongs to a group of vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) genes that, when functionally impaired, disrupt the efficient delivery of vacuolar hydrolases. The protein encoded by this gene is a component of a large multimeric complex, termed the retromer complex, which is involved in retrograde transport of proteins from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network. This VPS protein may be involved in the formation of the inner shell of the retromer coat for retrograde vesicles leaving the prevacuolar compartment. Alternative splice variants encoding different isoforms and representing non-protein coding transcripts have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene product is a member of the Vanin family of proteins that share extensive sequence similarity with each other, and also with biotinidase. The family includes secreted and membrane-associated proteins, a few of which have been reported to participate in hematopoietic cell trafficking. No biotinidase activity has been demonstrated for any of the vanin proteins, however, they possess pantetheinase activity, which may play a role in oxidative-stress response. The encoded protein is a GPI-anchored cell surface molecule that plays a role in transendothelial migration of neutrophils. This gene lies in close proximity to, and in same transcriptional orientation as two other vanin genes on chromosome 6q23-q24. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein is a component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that selectively ubiquitinates the alpha subunit of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) transcription factor for proteasome-mediated degradation. Inactivation of VHL causes VHL disease and sporadic kidney cancer. This gene encodes a VHL homolog that lacks one of two key domains necessary for VHL function. This gene may contribute to the regulation of oxygen homeostasis and neovascularization during placenta development. This gene is intronless, and can also be interpreted as a retrotransposed pseudogene of the VHL locus located on chromosome 3. However, the protein is represented in this RefSeq due to evidence in PMID:14757845 that strongly suggests it is translated. The same publication also indicates that this protein binds HIF alpha but fails to recruit the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, and it therefore functions as a dominant-negative VHL protein and a protector of HIF alpha.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is the human ortholog of the mouse VpreB3 (8HS20) protein, is thought to be involved in B-cell maturation, and may play a role in assembly of the pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR). While the role of this protein in B-cell development has not yet been elucidated, studies with the chicken ortholog of this protein have found that when overexpressed, this protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum. The mouse ortholog of this protein has been shown to associate with membrane mu heavy chains early in the course of pre-B cell receptor biosynthesis. Expression of this gene has been observed in some lymphomas.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes the catalytic subunit of the vitamin K epoxide reductase complex, which is responsible for the reduction of inactive vitamin K 2,3-epoxide to active vitamin K in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Vitamin K is a required co-factor for carboxylation of glutamic acid residues by vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxylase in blood-clotting enzymes. Allelic variation in this gene is associated with vitamin k-dependent clotting factors combined deficiency of 2, and increased resistance or sensitivity to warfarin, an inhibitor of vitamin K epoxide reductase. Pseudogenes of this gene are located on chromosomes 1 and X. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the PDGF/VEGF growth factor family. It encodes a heparin-binding protein, which exists as a disulfide-linked homodimer. This growth factor induces proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells, and is essential for both physiological and pathological angiogenesis. Disruption of this gene in mice resulted in abnormal embryonic blood vessel formation. This gene is upregulated in many known tumors and its expression is correlated with tumor stage and progression. Elevated levels of this protein are found in patients with POEMS syndrome, also known as Crow-Fukase syndrome. Allelic variants of this gene have been associated with microvascular complications of diabetes 1 (MVCD1) and atherosclerosis. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described. There is also evidence for alternative translation initiation from upstream non-AUG (CUG) codons resulting in additional isoforms. A recent study showed that a C-terminally extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform is antiangiogenic. Expression of some isoforms derived from the AUG start codon is regulated by a small upstream open reading frame, which is located within an internal ribosome entry site. The levels of VEGF are increased during infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), thus promoting inflammation by facilitating recruitment of inflammatory cells, and by increasing the level of angiopoietin II (Ang II), one of two products of the SARS-CoV-2 binding target, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In turn, Ang II facilitates the elevation of VEGF, thus forming a vicious cycle in the release of inflammatory cytokines.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene belongs to the VCX/Y gene family, which has multiple members on both X and Y chromosomes, and all are expressed exclusively in male germ cells. The X-linked members are clustered on chromosome Xp22 and Y-linked members are two identical copies of the gene within a palindromic region on Yq11. The family members share a high degree of sequence identity, with the exception that a 30-bp unit is tandemly repeated in X-linked members but occurs only once in Y-linked members. The VCX gene cluster is polymorphic in terms of copy number; different individuals may have a different number of VCX genes. VCX/Y genes encode small and highly charged proteins of unknown function. The presence of a putative bipartite nuclear localization signal suggests that VCX/Y members are nuclear proteins. This gene contains 10 repeats of the 30-bp unit.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene belongs to a group of vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) genes. The encoded protein is a component of a large multimeric complex, termed the retromer complex, involved in retrograde transport of proteins from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network. The close structural similarity between the yeast and human proteins that make up this complex suggests a similarity in function. Expression studies in yeast and mammalian cells indicate that this protein interacts directly with VPS35, which serves as the core of the retromer complex. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
Synaptobrevins/VAMPs, syntaxins, and the 25-kD synaptosomal-associated protein are the main components of a protein complex involved in the docking and/or fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane. This gene is a member of the vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)/synaptobrevin family. Because of its high homology to other known VAMPs, its broad tissue distribution, and its subcellular localization, the protein encoded by this gene was shown to be the human equivalent of the rodent cellubrevin. In platelets the protein resides on a compartment that is not mobilized to the plasma membrane on calcium or thrombin stimulation.","Variant counts

Synaptobrevins/VAMPs, syntaxins, and the 25-kD synaptosomal-associated protein SNAP25 are the main components of a protein complex involved in the docking and/or fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane. This gene is thought to participate in neurotransmitter release at a step between docking and fusion. The protein forms a stable complex with syntaxin, synaptosomal-associated protein, 25 kD, and synaptotagmin. It also forms a distinct complex with synaptophysin. It is a likely candidate gene for familial infantile myasthenia (FIMG) because of its map location and because it encodes a synaptic vesicle protein of the type that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of FIMG.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a member of the vaccinia-related kinase (VRK) family of serine/threonine protein kinases. This gene is widely expressed in human tissues and has increased expression in actively dividing cells, such as those in testis, thymus, fetal liver, and carcinomas. Its protein localizes to the nucleus and has been shown to promote the stability and nuclear accumulation of a transcriptionally active p53 molecule and, in vitro, to phosphorylate Thr18 of p53 and reduce p53 ubiquitination. This gene, therefore, may regulate cell proliferation. This protein also phosphorylates histone, casein, and the transcription factors ATF2 (activating transcription factor 2) and c-JUN.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes vitamin D3 receptor, which is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily of ligand-inducible transcription factors. This receptor also functions as a receptor for the secondary bile acid, lithocholic acid. Downstream targets of vitamin D3 receptor are principally involved in mineral metabolism, though this receptor regulates a variety of other metabolic pathways, such as those involved in immune response and cancer. Mutations in this gene are associated with type II vitamin D-resistant rickets. A single nucleotide polymorphism in the initiation codon results in an alternate translation start site three codons downstream. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene. A recent study provided evidence for translational readthrough in this gene, and expression of an additional C-terminally extended isoform via the use of an alternative in-frame translation termination codon.","Variant counts

Summary
Vesicle mediated protein sorting plays an important role in segregation of intracellular molecules into distinct organelles. Genetic studies in yeast have identified more than 40 vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) genes involved in vesicle transport to vacuoles. This gene encodes the human homolog of yeast class C Vps11 protein. The mammalian class C Vps proteins are predominantly associated with late endosomes/lysosomes, and like their yeast counterparts, may mediate vesicle trafficking steps in the endosome/lysosome pathway. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a transmembrane protein which has been localized to adherens junctions and shown to bind to myosin VIIA. Examination of expression of this gene in gastric cancer tissues have shown that expression is decreased which appears to be related to hypermethylation of the promoter. Expression of this gene may also be inhibited by binding of a specific microRNA to a target sequence in the 3' UTR of the transcripts. A pseudogene of this gene is located on the X chromosome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of a family of human VCX/Y genes. This gene family has multiple members on both X and Y chromosomes, and all are expressed exclusively in male germ cells. Members of the VCX/Y family share a high degree of sequence identity, with the exception that a 30-bp unit is tandemly repeated in X-linked members but occurs only once in Y-linked members. VCX/Y genes encode small and highly charged proteins of unknown function. This gene encodes a small, positively charged protein. The presence of a putative bipartite nuclear localization signal suggests that this gene encodes a nuclear protein. The genome has two identical copies of this gene within a palindromic region; this record represents the more telomeric copy.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene functions in part as an adhesive glycoprotein. Differential expression of this protein can promote either cell adhesion or migration as it links cells to the extracellular matrix through a variety of ligands. These ligands include integrins, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor. This secreted protein can be present in the plasma as a monomer or dimer and forms a multimer in the extracellular matrix of several tissues. This protein also inhibits the membrane-damaging effect of the terminal cytolytic complement pathway and binds to several serpin serine protease inhibitors. This protein can also promote extracellular matrix degradation and thus plays a role in tumorigenesis. It is involved in a variety of other biological processes such as the regulation of the coagulation pathway, wound healing, and tissue remodeling. The heparin-binding domain of this protein give it anti-microbial properties. It is also a lipid binding protein that forms a principal component of high density lipoprotein.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene interacts with the Von Hippel-Lindau protein to form an intracellular complex. The encoded protein functions as a chaperone protein, and may play a role in the transport of the Von Hippel-Lindau protein from the perinuclear granules to the nucleus or cytoplasm. Alternative splicing and the use of alternate transcription start sites results in multiple transcript variants encoding different protein isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene belongs to the VCX/Y gene family, which has multiple members on both X and Y chromosomes, and all are expressed exclusively in male germ cells. The X-linked members are clustered on chromosome Xp22, and the Y-linked members are two identical copies of the gene within a palindromic region on chromosome Yq11. The family members share a high degree of sequence identity, with the exception that a 30-nt unit is tandemly repeated in X-linked members but occurs only once in Y-linked members. The VCX gene cluster is polymorphic in terms of copy number; different individuals may have a different number of VCX genes. This family member, as represented by the reference genome allele, contains 14 copies of the 30-nt repeat unit. VCX/Y genes encode small and highly charged proteins containing putative bipartite nuclear localization signals. Although the exact function of this family member has yet to be determined, a role in mRNA stability regulation can be inferred from the ability of the highly similar family member, VCX-A, to inhibit mRNA decapping. A possible role in the regulation of ribosome assembly during spermatogenesis has also been suggested.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a shared subunit of two multi-component complexes, the histone acetyltransferase complex TRRAP/TIP60 as well as the chromatin remodeling SRCAP-containing complex. The TRRAP/TIP60 complex acetylates nucleosomal histones important for transcriptional regulation, double strand DNA break repair and apoptosis. The SRCAP-containing complex catalyzes the exchange of histone H2A with the histone variant Htz1 (H2AFZ) into nucleosomes. This protein may be responsible for binding H2AFZ, which has a role in chromosome segregation. This protein may also have a role in regulating long-term hematopoietic stem cell activity. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants that encode different protein isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
Vesicle mediated protein sorting plays an important role in segregation of intracellular molecules into distinct organelles. Genetic studies in yeast have identified more than 40 vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) genes involved in vesicle transport to vacuoles. This gene is a member of the Sec-1 domain family, and encodes the human ortholog of rat Vps33b which is homologous to the yeast class C Vps33 protein. The mammalian class C vacuolar protein sorting proteins are predominantly associated with late endosomes/lysosomes, and like their yeast counterparts, may mediate vesicle trafficking steps in the endosome/lysosome pathway. Mutations in this gene are associated with arthrogryposis-renal dysfunction-cholestasis syndrome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a tethering protein and a core subunit of the homotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS) complex. The HOPS complex and a second endosomal tethering complex called the class C core vacuole/endosome tethering (CORVET) complex, perform diverse functions in endocytosis including membrane tethering, RabGTPase interaction, activation and proofreading of synaptic-soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor (SNARE) assembly to drive membrane fusion, and endosome-to-cytoskeleton attachment. The HOPS complex controls endosome maturation as well as endosome traffic to the lysosome. This complex is essential for vacuolar fusion and is required for adaptor protein complex 3-dependent transport from the golgi to the vacuole. The encoded protein belongs to the Sec1/Munc18 (SM) family of SNARE-mediated membrane fusion regulators. Naturally occurring mutations in this gene are associated with a novel mucopolysaccharidosis-like disease.","Variant counts

Summary
Vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) is a member of the Ena-VASP protein family. Ena-VASP family members contain an EHV1 N-terminal domain that binds proteins containing E/DFPPPPXD/E motifs and targets Ena-VASP proteins to focal adhesions. In the mid-region of the protein, family members have a proline-rich domain that binds SH3 and WW domain-containing proteins. Their C-terminal EVH2 domain mediates tetramerization and binds both G and F actin. VASP is associated with filamentous actin formation and likely plays a widespread role in cell adhesion and motility. VASP may also be involved in the intracellular signaling pathways that regulate integrin-extracellular matrix interactions. VASP is regulated by the cyclic nucleotide-dependent kinases PKA and PKG.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), and belongs to the mitochondrial porin family. VDACs are small, integral membrane proteins that traverse the outer mitochondrial membrane and conduct ATP and other small metabolites. They are known to bind several kinases of intermediary metabolism, thought to be involved in translocation of adenine nucleotides, and are hypothesized to form part of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, which results in the release of cytochrome c at the onset of apoptotic cell death. Alternatively transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the voltage-dependent anion channel pore-forming family of proteins that are considered the main pathway for metabolite diffusion across the mitochondrial outer membrane. The encoded protein is also thought to be involved in the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway via regulation of BCL2-antagonist/killer 1 protein activity. Pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes 1, 2, 12 and 21, and alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts
