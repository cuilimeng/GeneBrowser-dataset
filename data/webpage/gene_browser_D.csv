Summary
This gene encodes a member of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family of transcription factors. The protein functions as a dominant-negative inhibitor by forming heterodimers with other C/EBP members, such as C/EBP and LAP (liver activator protein), and preventing their DNA binding activity. The protein is implicated in adipogenesis and erythropoiesis, is activated by endoplasmic reticulum stress, and promotes apoptosis. Fusion of this gene and FUS on chromosome 16 or EWSR1 on chromosome 22 induced by translocation generates chimeric proteins in myxoid liposarcomas or Ewing sarcoma. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding two isoforms with different length have been identified.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes dystroglycan, a central component of dystrophin-glycoprotein complex that links the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton in the skeletal muscle. The encoded preproprotein undergoes O- and N-glycosylation, and proteolytic processing to generate alpha and beta subunits. Certain mutations in this gene are known to cause distinct forms of muscular dystrophy. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, all encoding the same protein.","Variant counts

This gene is one of two human genes similar to the yeast gene dph2. The yeast gene was identified by its ability to complement a diphthamide mutant strain, and thus probably functions in diphthamide biosynthesis. Diphthamide is a post-translationally modified histidine residue present in elongation factor 2 (EF2) that is the target of diphtheria toxin ADP-ribosylation. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a component of the diphthamide synthesis pathway. Diphthamide is a post-translationally modified histidine residue found only on translation elongation factor 2. It is conserved from archaebacteria to humans, and is targeted by diphtheria toxin and Pseudomonas exotoxin A to halt cellular protein synthesis. The yeast and Chinese hamster homologs of this protein catalyze the trimethylation of the histidine residue on elongation factor 2, resulting in a diphthine moiety that is subsequently amidated to yield diphthamide. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan family of proteins. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, at least one of which encodes a preproprotein that is proteolytically processed to generate the mature protein. This protein plays a role in collagen fibril assembly. Binding of this protein to multiple cell surface receptors mediates its role in tumor suppression, including a stimulatory effect on autophagy and inflammation and an inhibitory effect on angiogenesis and tumorigenesis. This gene and the related gene biglycan are thought to be the result of a gene duplication. Mutations in this gene are associated with congenital stromal corneal dystrophy in human patients.","Variant counts

Deficiency of DCK is associated with resistance to antiviral and anticancer chemotherapeutic agents. Conversely, increased deoxycytidine kinase activity is associated with increased activation of these compounds to cytotoxic nucleoside triphosphate derivatives. DCK is clinically important because of its relationship to drug resistance and sensitivity.","Variant counts

The cytoplasmic tail interacts with the tyrosine kinases Src and focal adhesion kinase (FAK, also known as PTK2) to mediate axon attraction. The protein partially localizes to lipid rafts, and induces apoptosis in the absence of ligand. The protein functions as a tumor suppressor, and is frequently mutated or downregulated in colorectal cancer and esophageal carcinoma.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the doublecortin family. The protein encoded by this gene is a cytoplasmic protein and contains two doublecortin domains, which bind microtubules. In the developing cortex, cortical neurons must migrate over long distances to reach the site of their final differentiation. The encoded protein appears to direct neuronal migration by regulating the organization and stability of microtubules. In addition, the encoded protein interacts with LIS1, the regulatory gamma subunit of platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase, and this interaction is important to proper microtubule function in the developing cortex. Mutations in this gene cause abnormal migration of neurons during development and disrupt the layering of the cortex, leading to epilepsy, cognitive disability, subcortical band heterotopia ('double cortex' syndrome) in females and lissencephaly ('smooth brain' syndrome) in males. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a component of the motor complex, cytoplasmic dynein, which transports cellular cargo along microtubules in the cell. The encoded protein regulates the length of primary cilia which are sensory organelles found on the surface of cells. The protein encoded by this gene interacts with viral proteins, like the minor capsid protein L2 of human papillomavirus, and is required for dynein-mediated delivery of the viral nucleic acid to the host nucleus. This protein interacts with oncogenic nucleoporins to disrupt gene regulation and cause leukemic transformation. Pseudogenes of this gene are present on chromosomes 4 and 17. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the histidine triad family of pyrophosphatases that removes short mRNA fragments containing the 5' mRNA cap structure, which appear in the 3' -> 5' mRNA decay pathway, following deadenylation and exosome-mediated turnover. This enzyme hydrolyzes the triphosphate linkage of the cap structure (7-methylguanosine nucleoside triphosphate) to yield 7-methylguanosine monophosphate and nucleoside diphosphate. It protects the cell from the potentially toxic accumulation of these short, capped mRNA fragments, and regulates the activity of other cap-binding proteins, which are inhibited by their accumulation. It also acts as a transcript-specific modulator of pre-mRNA splicing and microRNA turnover.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a 50-kD subunit of dynactin, a macromolecular complex consisting of 10-11 subunits ranging in size from 22 to 150 kD. Dynactin binds to both microtubules and cytoplasmic dynein. It is involved in a diverse array of cellular functions, including ER-to-Golgi transport, the centripetal movement of lysosomes and endosomes, spindle formation, chromosome movement, nuclear positioning, and axonogenesis. This subunit is present in 4-5 copies per dynactin molecule. It contains three short alpha-helical coiled-coil domains that may mediate association with self or other dynactin subunits. It may interact directly with the largest subunit (p150) of dynactin and may affix p150 in place. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a ribonuclease (RNase) III double-stranded RNA-specific ribonuclease and subunit of the microprocessor protein complex, which catalyzes the initial processing step of microRNA (miRNA) synthesis. The encoded protein cleaves the stem loop structure from the primary microRNA (pri-miRNA) in the nucleus, yielding the precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), which is then exported to the cytoplasm for further processing. In a human cell line lacking a functional copy of this gene, canonical miRNA synthesis is reduced. Somatic mutations in this gene have been observed in human patients with kidney cancer.","Variant counts

Summary
Cytoplasmic dyneins are large enzyme complexes with a molecular mass of about 1,200 kD. They contain two force-producing heads formed primarily from dynein heavy chains, and stalks linking the heads to a basal domain, which contains a varying number of accessory intermediate chains. The complex is involved in intracellular transport and motility. The protein described in this record is a light chain and exists as part of this complex but also physically interacts with and inhibits the activity of neuronal nitric oxide synthase. Binding of this protein destabilizes the neuronal nitric oxide synthase dimer, a conformation necessary for activity, and it may regulate numerous biologic processes through its effects on nitric oxide synthase activity. Alternate transcriptional splice variants have been characterized.","Variant counts

Summary
The exact function of this gene is not known. It encodes a protein with a DALR anticodon binding domain similar to that of class Ia aminoacyl tRNA synthetases. This gene is located in a cluster of genes (with a complex sense-anti-sense genome architecture) on chromosome 3, and contains two micro RNA (miRNA) precursors (mir-425 and mir-191) in one of its introns. Preferential expression of this gene (the miRNAs and other genes in the cluster) in testis suggests a role of this gene in spermatogenesis (PMID:19906709).","Variant counts

DEAD box proteins, characterized by the conserved motif Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD), are putative RNA helicases. They are implicated in a number of cellular processes involving alteration of RNA secondary structure such as translation initiation, nuclear and mitochondrial splicing, and ribosome and spliceosome assembly. Based on their distribution patterns, some members of this family are believed to be involved in embryogenesis, spermatogenesis, and cellular growth and division. This gene encodes a DEAD box protein, which shows little similarity to any of the other known human DEAD box proteins, but shows a high similarity to mouse Ddx24 at the amino acid level.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the hedgehog family. The hedgehog gene family encodes signaling molecules that play an important role in regulating morphogenesis. This protein is predicted to be made as a precursor that is autocatalytically cleaved; the N-terminal portion is soluble and contains the signalling activity while the C-terminal portion is involved in precursor processing. More importantly, the C-terminal product covalently attaches a cholesterol moiety to the N-terminal product, restricting the N-terminal product to the cell surface and preventing it from freely diffusing throughout the organism. Defects in this protein have been associated with partial gonadal dysgenesis (PGD) accompanied by minifascicular polyneuropathy. This protein may be involved in both male gonadal differentiation and perineurial development.","Variant counts

This gene is a member of the DNA polymerase type-X family and encodes a template-independent DNA polymerase that catalyzes the addition of deoxynucleotides to the 3'-hydroxyl terminus of oligonucleotide primers. In vivo, the encoded protein is expressed in a restricted population of normal and malignant pre-B and pre-T lymphocytes during early differentiation, where it generates antigen receptor diversity by synthesizing non-germ line elements (N-regions) at the junctions of rearranged Ig heavy chain and T cell receptor gene segments. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms of this gene have been described.","Variant counts

Based on their distribution patterns, some members of this DEAD box protein family are believed to be involved in embryogenesis, spermatogenesis, and cellular growth and division. This gene encodes a member of this family. The function of this member has not been determined. Alternative splicing of this gene generates multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a calcium-dependent glycoprotein that is a member of the desmocollin subfamily of the cadherin superfamily. These desmosomal family members, along with the desmogleins, are found primarily in epithelial cells where they constitute the adhesive proteins of the desmosome cell-cell junction and are required for cell adhesion and desmosome formation. A subtype of IgA pemphigus, a life-threatening autoimmune disease, is characterized by the presence of autoantibodies that target the encoded protein. The desmosomal family members are arranged in two clusters on chromosome 18. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants. At least one of these variants encodes a preproprotein that is proteolytically processed to generate the mature protein.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the large DEAD-box protein family, that is defined by the presence of the conserved Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD) motif, and has ATP-dependent RNA helicase activity. This protein has been reported to display a high level of RNA-independent ATPase activity, and unlike most DEAD-box helicases, the ATPase activity is thought to be stimulated by both RNA and DNA. This protein has multiple conserved domains and is thought to play roles in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Nuclear roles include transcriptional regulation, mRNP assembly, pre-mRNA splicing, and mRNA export. In the cytoplasm, this protein is thought to be involved in translation, cellular signaling, and viral replication. Misregulation of this gene has been implicated in tumorigenesis. This gene has a paralog located in the nonrecombining region of the Y chromosome. Pseudogenes sharing similarity to both this gene and the DDX3Y paralog are found on chromosome 4 and the X chromosome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the DEAD-box RNA helicase family, characterized by nine conserved motifs, included the conserved Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD) motif. These motifs are thought to be involved in ATP binding, hydrolysis, RNA binding, and in the formation of intramolecular interactions. This protein shares high similarity to DDX3X, on the X chromosome, but a deletion of this gene is not complemented by DDX3X. Mutations in this gene result in male infertility, a reduction in germ cell numbers, and can result in Sertoli-cell only sydrome. Pseudogenes sharing similarity to both this gene and the DDX3X paralog are found on chromosome 4 and the X chromosome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a mitogen-responsive phosphoprotein. It is expressed in normal ovarian epithelial cells, but is down-regulated or absent from ovarian carcinoma cell lines, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor. This protein binds to the SH3 domains of GRB2, an adaptor protein that couples tyrosine kinase receptors to SOS (a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras), via its C-terminal proline-rich sequences, and may thus modulate growth factor/Ras pathways by competing with SOS for binding to GRB2. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Dolichol-phosphate mannose (Dol-P-Man) serves as a donor of mannosyl residues on the lumenal side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Lack of Dol-P-Man results in defective surface expression of GPI-anchored proteins. Dol-P-Man is synthesized from GDP-mannose and dolichol-phosphate on the cytosolic side of the ER by the enzyme dolichyl-phosphate mannosyltransferase. Human DPM1 lacks a carboxy-terminal transmembrane domain and signal sequence and is regulated by DPM2. Mutations in this gene are associated with congenital disorder of glycosylation type Ie. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The cytogenetic location of this gene is 3p21.3, and it is located in a region that is commonly deleted in a variety of malignancies. Down-regulation of this gene has been observed in several human cancers including lung, esophageal, renal tumors, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. In some cases, reduced expression of this gene in tumor cells is a result of aberrant promoter methylation. Several alternatively spliced transcripts have been observed that contain disrupted coding regions and likely encode nonfunctional proteins.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the intracellular phospholipase A1 gene family. The protein encoded by this gene preferentially hydrolyzes phosphatidic acid. It is a cytosolic protein with some mitochondrial localization, and is thought to be involved in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics. Overexpression of this gene causes fragmentation of the tubular structures in mitochondria, while depletion of the gene results in mitochondrial tubule elongation. Deletion of this gene in male mice caused fertility defects, resulting from disruption in the organization of the mitochondria during spermiogenesis. In humans, mutations in this gene have been associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), also known as Strumpell-Lorrain disease, or, familial spastic paraparesis (FSP). This inherited disorder is characterized by progressive weakness and spasticity of the legs. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a glycoprotein and a member of the NADPH oxidase family. The synthesis of thyroid hormone is catalyzed by a protein complex located at the apical membrane of thyroid follicular cells. This complex contains an iodide transporter, thyroperoxidase, and a peroxide generating system that includes proteins encoded by this gene and the similar DUOX2 gene. This protein is known as dual oxidase because it has both a peroxidase homology domain and a gp91phox domain. This protein generates hydrogen peroxide and thereby plays a role in the activity of thyroid peroxidase, lactoperoxidase, and in lactoperoxidase-mediated antimicrobial defense at mucosal surfaces. Two alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein have been described for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
DEAD box proteins, characterized by the conserved motif Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD), are putative RNA helicases. They are implicated in a number of cellular processes involving alteration of RNA secondary structure such as translation initiation, nuclear and mitochondrial splicing, and ribosome and spliceosome assembly. Based on their distribution patterns, some members of this family are believed to be involved in embryogenesis, spermatogenesis, and cellular growth and division. This gene encodes a DEAD box protein, which is a functional homolog of fission yeast Prp8 protein involved in cell cycle progression. This gene is mapped to the MHC region on chromosome 6p21.3, a region where many malignant, genetic and autoimmune disease genes are linked. Three transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the protein kinase superfamily and the doublecortin family. The protein encoded by this gene contains two N-terminal doublecortin domains, which bind microtubules and regulate microtubule polymerization, a C-terminal serine/threonine protein kinase domain, which shows substantial homology to Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, and a serine/proline-rich domain in between the doublecortin and the protein kinase domains, which mediates multiple protein-protein interactions. The microtubule-polymerizing activity of the encoded protein is independent of its protein kinase activity. The encoded protein is involved in several different cellular processes, including neuronal migration, retrograde transport, neuronal apoptosis and neurogenesis. This gene is up-regulated by brain-derived neurotrophic factor and associated with memory and general cognitive abilities. Multiple transcript variants generated by two alternative promoter usage and alternative splicing have been reported, but the full-length nature and biological validity of some variants have not been defined. These variants encode different isoforms, which are differentially expressed and have different kinase activities.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the protein kinase superfamily and the doublecortin family. The protein encoded by this gene contains two N-terminal doublecortin domains, which bind microtubules and regulate microtubule polymerization, a C-terminal serine/threonine protein kinase domain, which shows substantial homology to Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, and a serine/proline-rich domain in between the doublecortin and the protein kinase domains, which mediates multiple protein-protein interactions. The microtubule-polymerizing activity of the encoded protein is independent of its protein kinase activity. Mouse studies show that the DCX gene, another family member, and this gene share function in the establishment of hippocampal organization and that their absence results in a severe epileptic phenotype and lethality, as described in human patients with lissencephaly. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been identified.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that is a component of the dynein-2 microtubule motor protein complex that plays a role in the retrograde transport of cargo in primary cilia via the intraflagellar transport system. This gene is ubiquitously expressed and its protein, which localizes to the axoneme and Golgi apparatus, interacts directly with the cytoplasmic dynein 2 heavy chain 1 protein to form part of the multi-protein dynein-2 complex. Mutations in this gene produce defects in the dynein-2 complex which result in several types of ciliopathy including short-rib thoracic dysplasia 15 with polydactyly (SRTD15). Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.","Variant counts

Defensins form a family of antimicrobial and cytotoxic peptides made by neutrophils. Defensins are short, processed peptide molecules that are classified by structure into three groups: alpha-defensins, beta-defensins and theta-defensins. All beta-defensin genes are densely clustered in four to five syntenic chromosomal regions. Chromosome 8p23 contains at least two copies of the duplicated beta-defensin cluster. This duplication results in two identical copies of defensin, beta 107, DEFB107A and DEFB107B, in tail-to-tail orientation. This gene, DEFB107B, represents the more telomeric copy.","Variant counts

Summary
Dual oxidases DUOX1 and DUOX2 are NADPH oxidases which are involved in hydrogen peroxide production necessary for thyroid hormonogenesis. They form a heterodimer with specific maturation factors DUOXA1 and DUOXA2, respectively, which is essential for the maturation and function of the DUOX enzyme complexes. This gene encodes the DUOX1 activator or maturation factor DUOXA1. Rat studies identified a bidirectional promoter which controls the transcription of the DUOX1 and DUOXA1 genes. This protein is cotransported to the cell surface when coexpressed with DUOX1 and is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum when expressed without DUOX1 protein. The expression of this gene or the DUOX1 gene is not suppressed by thyroglobulin (Tg), a macromolecular precursor in thyroid hormone synthesis, while the expression of the DUOX2 and DUOXA2 are significantly suppressed by the Tg. This protein is also a p53-regulated neurogenic factor involved in p53 dependent neuronal differentiation. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the DEAH box polypeptide family. The encoded protein contains the DEAH (Asp-Glu-Ala-His) motif which is characteristic of all DEAH box proteins, and is thought to function as an ATP-dependent RNA helicase that regulates the release of spliced mRNAs from spliceosomes prior to their export from the nucleus. This protein may be required for the replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The DAZ (Deleted in AZoospermia) gene family encodes potential RNA binding proteins that are expressed in prenatal and postnatal germ cells of males and females. The protein encoded by this gene is localized to the nucleus and cytoplasm of fetal germ cells and to the cytoplasm of developing oocytes. In the testis, this protein is localized to the nucleus of spermatogonia but relocates to the cytoplasm during meiosis where it persists in spermatids and spermatozoa. Transposition and amplification of this autosomal gene during primate evolution gave rise to the DAZ gene cluster on the Y chromosome. Mutations in this gene have been linked to severe spermatogenic failure and infertility in males. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Apoptosis is a cell death process that removes toxic and/or useless cells during mammalian development. The apoptotic process is accompanied by shrinkage and fragmentation of the cells and nuclei and degradation of the chromosomal DNA into nucleosomal units. DNA fragmentation factor (DFF) is a heterodimeric protein of 40-kD (DFFB) and 45-kD (DFFA) subunits. DFFA is the substrate for caspase-3 and triggers DNA fragmentation during apoptosis. DFF becomes activated when DFFA is cleaved by caspase-3. The cleaved fragments of DFFA dissociate from DFFB, the active component of DFF. DFFB has been found to trigger both DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation during apoptosis. Two alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Apoptosis is a cell death process that removes toxic and/or useless cells during mammalian development. The apoptotic process is accompanied by shrinkage and fragmentation of the cells and nuclei and degradation of the chromosomal DNA into nucleosomal units. DNA fragmentation factor (DFF) is a heterodimeric protein of 40-kD (DFFB) and 45-kD (DFFA) subunits. DFFA is the substrate for caspase-3 and triggers DNA fragmentation during apoptosis. DFF becomes activated when DFFA is cleaved by caspase-3. The cleaved fragments of DFFA dissociate from DFFB, the active component of DFF. DFFB has been found to trigger both DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation during apoptosis. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been found for this gene but the biological validity of some of these variants has not been determined.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that is required for the formation of hypusine, a unique amino acid formed by the posttranslational modification of only one protein, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A. The encoded protein catalyzes the first step in hypusine formation by transferring the butylamine moiety of spermidine to a specific lysine residue of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A precursor, forming an intermediate deoxyhypusine residue. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the WD repeat protein family. WD repeats are minimally conserved regions of approximately 40 amino acids typically bracketed by Gly-His and Trp-Asp (GH-WD), which may facilitate formation of heterotrimeric or multi-protein complexes. Members of this family are involved in a variety of cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, signal transduction, apoptosis, and gene regulation. This gene appears to represent an intronless retrocopy of a related multi-exon gene located on chromosome 9. However, the CDS of this intronless gene remains intact, it is conserved in other mammalian species, it is known to be transcribed, and it is therefore thought to encode a functional protein.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene belongs to the dystrophin superfamily, which is characterized by the presence of four EF-hand motifs and a ZZ-domain. It is a likely ortholog of the Drosophila 'discontinuous actin hexagon' gene. It is noteworthy that the coding region of this gene lacks two coding exons that are found in the mouse ortholog. Human transcripts including these two exons are subject to nonsense-mediated transcript decay (NMD). On the other hand, transcripts skipping the two coding exons are expressed at very low levels. While this gene maintains an intact CDS, it may be an evolving pseudogene. However, after a discussion about this gene within the RefSeq group, as well as in the consensus coding sequence (CCDS) collaboration, it was decided to keep it as a protein-coding gene in the RefSeq, Ensembl-GENCODE and the CCDS sets.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is an actin binding and bundling protein that plays a structural role in erythrocytes, by stabilizing and attaching the spectrin/actin cytoskeleton to the erythrocyte membrane in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. This protein contains a core domain in the N-terminus, and a headpiece domain in the C-terminus that binds F-actin. When purified from erythrocytes, this protein exists as a trimer composed of two 48 kDa polypeptides and a 52 kDa polypeptide. The different subunits arise from alternative splicing in the 3' coding region, where the headpiece domain is located. Disruption of this gene has been correlated with the autosomal dominant Marie Unna hereditary hypotrichosis disease, while loss of heterozygosity of this gene is thought to play a role in prostate cancer progression. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

This gene is expressed with transcripts of 6.0, 7.5, and 8.0 kb in fetal lung and with one transcript of 8.0 kb in adult lung, although the 7.5 kb transcript has not been characterized. The encoded protein precursor is a glycoprotein containing multiple scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domains separated by SRCR-interspersed domains (SID). Transcript variant 2 (8.0 kb) has been shown to bind surfactant protein D independently of carbohydrate recognition. This indicates that DMBT1 may not be a classical tumor suppressor gene, but rather play a role in the interaction of tumor cells and the immune system.","Variant counts

DEAD box proteins, characterized by the conserved motif Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD), are putative RNA helicases. They are implicated in a number of cellular processes involving alteration of RNA secondary structure such as translation initiation, nuclear and mitochondrial splicing, and ribosome and spliceosome assembly. Based on their distribution patterns, some members of this family are believed to be involved in embryogenesis, spermatogenesis, and cellular growth and division. This gene encodes a DEAD box protein, which is a homolog of VASA proteins in Drosophila and several other species. The gene is specifically expressed in the germ cell lineage in both sexes and functions in germ cell development. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the DEAD box family of RNA helicases that are involved in a variety of cellular processes as a result of its role as an adaptor molecule, promoting interactions with a large number of other factors. This protein is involved in pathways that include the alteration of RNA structures, plays a role as a coregulator of transcription, a regulator of splicing, and in the processing of small noncoding RNAs. Members of this family contain nine conserved motifs, including the conserved Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD) motif, important to ATP binding and hydrolysis as well as RNA binding and unwinding activities. Dysregulation of this gene may play a role in cancer development. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the WD repeat protein family. WD repeats are minimally conserved regions of approximately 40 amino acids typically bracketed by Gly-His and Trp-Asp (GH-WD), which may facilitate the formation of heterotrimeric or multi-protein complexes. Members of this family are involved in a variety of cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, signal transduction, apoptosis, and gene regulation. This gene appears to represent an intronless retrocopy of a related multi-exon gene located on chromosome 1. However, the CDS of this intronless gene remains intact, it is conserved in other primate species, it is known to be transcribed, and it is therefore thought to encode a functional protein.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the BMP (bone morphogenic protein) antagonist family. Like BMPs, BMP antagonists contain cystine knots and typically form homo- and heterodimers. The CAN (cerberus and dan) subfamily of BMP antagonists, to which this gene belongs, is characterized by a C-terminal cystine knot with an eight-membered ring. The antagonistic effect of the secreted protein encoded by this gene is likely due to its direct binding to BMP proteins. As an antagonist of BMP, this gene may play a role in regulating organogenesis, body patterning, and tissue differentiation. In mouse, this protein has been shown to bind Nodal and to inhibit the Nodal signaling pathway which patterns left/right body asymmetry.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the family of discs large (DLG) homologs, a subset of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) superfamily. The MAGUK proteins are composed of a catalytically inactive guanylate kinase domain, in addition to PDZ and SH3 domains, and are thought to function as scaffolding molecules at sites of cell-cell contact. The protein encoded by this gene localizes to the plasma membrane and cytoplasm, and interacts with components of adherens junctions and the cytoskeleton. It is proposed to function in the transmission of extracellular signals to the cytoskeleton and in the maintenance of epithelial cell structure. Alternative splice variants have been described but their biological nature has not been determined.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the DEAD box family of RNA-dependent ATPases that mediate ATP hydrolysis during pre-mRNA splicing. The encoded protein is an essential splicing factor required for association of U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein with pre-mRNA, and it also plays an important role in mRNA export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. This gene belongs to a cluster of genes localized in the vicinity of the genes encoding tumor necrosis factor alpha and tumor necrosis factor beta. These genes are all within the human major histocompatibility complex class III region. Mutations in this gene may be associated with rheumatoid arthritis. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Related pseudogenes have been identified on both chromosomes 6 and 11. Read-through transcription also occurs between this gene and the upstream ATP6V1G2 (ATPase, H+ transporting, lysosomal 13kDa, V1 subunit G2) gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the DEAD box protein family. These proteins are characterized by the conserved motif Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD) and are putative RNA helicases. They are implicated in a number of cellular processes involving alteration of RNA secondary structure, such as translation initiation, nuclear and mitochondrial splicing, and ribosome and spliceosome assembly. Based on their distribution patterns, some members of the DEAD box protein family are believed to be involved in embryogenesis, spermatogenesis, and cellular growth and division. This gene is thought to play a role in the prognosis of patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors. A pseudogene of this gene is present on chromosome 13. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Additional alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been described, but their full-length nature is not known.","Variant counts

Summary
In mammals, the Y chromosome directs the development of the testes and plays an important role in spermatogenesis. A high percentage of infertile men have deletions that map to regions of the Y chromosome. The DAZ (deleted in azoospermia) gene cluster maps to the AZFc region of the Y chromosome and is deleted in many azoospermic and severely oligospermic men. It is thought that the DAZ gene cluster arose from the transposition, amplification, and pruning of the ancestral autosomal gene DAZL also involved in germ cell development and gametogenesis. This gene encodes a RNA-binding protein with two RNP motifs that was originally identified by its interaction with the infertility factors DAZ and DAZL. Two isoforms are encoded by transcript variants of this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes an essential enzyme of nucleotide metabolism. The encoded protein forms a ubiquitous, homotetrameric enzyme that hydrolyzes dUTP to dUMP and pyrophosphate. This reaction serves two cellular purposes: providing a precursor (dUMP) for the synthesis of thymine nucleotides needed for DNA replication, and limiting intracellular pools of dUTP. Elevated levels of dUTP lead to increased incorporation of uracil into DNA, which induces extensive excision repair mediated by uracil glycosylase. This repair process, resulting in the removal and reincorporation of dUTP, is self-defeating and leads to DNA fragmentation and cell death. Alternative splicing of this gene leads to different isoforms that localize to either the mitochondrion or nucleus. A related pseudogene is located on chromosome 19.","Variant counts

Summary
The pattern of cellular proliferation and differentiation that leads to normal development of embryonic structures often depends upon the localized production of secreted protein signals. Cells surrounding the source of a particular signal respond in a graded manner according to the effective concentration of the signal, and this response produces the pattern of cell types constituting the mature structure. A novel segment-polarity gene known as dispatched has been identified in Drosophila and its protein product is required for normal Hedgehog (Hh) signaling. This gene is one of two human homologs of Drosophila dispatched and, based on sequence identity to its mouse counterpart, the encoded protein may play an essential role in Hh patterning activities in the early embryo.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a molecular chaperone, tumor suppressor, and member of the heat shock protein-40 family. The encoded protein binds the cell adhesion protein E-cadherin and targets it to the plasma membrane. This protein also binds incorrectly folded E-cadherin and targets it for endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation. This gene is a strong tumor suppressor for colorectal carcinoma, and downregulation of it may serve as a good biomarker for predicting patient outcomes. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Apoptosis, a major form of cell death, is an efficient mechanism for eliminating unwanted cells and is of central importance for development and homeostasis in metazoan animals. In mice, the death inducer-obliterator-1 gene is upregulated by apoptotic signals and encodes a cytoplasmic protein that translocates to the nucleus upon apoptotic signal activation. When overexpressed, the mouse protein induced apoptosis in cell lines growing in vitro. This gene is similar to the mouse gene and therefore is thought to be involved in apoptosis. Alternatively spliced transcripts have been found for this gene, encoding multiple isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
DEAD box proteins, characterized by the conserved motif Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD), are putative RNA helicases. They are implicated in a number of cellular processes involving alteration of RNA secondary structure such as translation initiation, nuclear and mitochondrial splicing, and ribosome and spliceosome assembly. Based on their distribution patterns, some members of this DEAD box protein family are believed to be involved in embryogenesis, spermatogenesis, and cellular growth and division. This gene encodes a DEAD box enzyme that may be involved in ribosomal RNA synthesis or processing. This gene and DDX21, also called RH-II/GuA, have similar genomic structures and are in tandem orientation on chromosome 10, suggesting that the two genes arose by gene duplication in evolution. This gene has pseudogenes on chromosomes 2, 3 and 4. Alternative splicing of this gene generates multiple transcript variants, but the full length nature of all the other variants but one has not been defined.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the DEAD box protein family. DEAD box proteins, characterized by the conserved motif Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD), are putative RNA helicases. They are implicated in a number of cellular processes involving alteration of RNA secondary structure such as translation initiation, nuclear and mitochondrial splicing, and ribosome and spliceosome assembly. Based on their distribution patterns, some members of this family are believed to be involved in embryogenesis, spermatogenesis, and cellular growth and division. The protein encoded by this gene shows ATPase activity in the presence of polynucleotides and associates with nucleoplasmic 65S preribosomal particles. This gene may be involved in ribosome synthesis, most likely during assembly of the large 60S ribosomal subunit. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes an inner dynein arm heavy chain that provides structural support between the radial spokes and the outer doublet of the sperm tail. Naturally occurring mutations in this gene are associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia and multiple morphological anomalies of the flagella that result in asthenozoospermia and male infertility. Mice with a homozygous knockout of the orthologous gene are viable but have reduced sperm motility and are infertile.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a dynein protein, which is part of a microtubule-associated motor protein complex consisting of heavy, light, and intermediate chains. This protein is an axonemal heavy chain dynein. It functions as a force-generating protein with ATPase activity, whereby the release of ADP is thought to produce the force-producing power stroke. Mutations in this gene cause primary ciliary dyskinesia type 3, as well as Kartagener syndrome, which are both diseases due to ciliary defects.","Variant counts

This gene encodes diazepam binding inhibitor, a protein that is regulated by hormones and is involved in lipid metabolism and the displacement of beta-carbolines and benzodiazepines, which modulate signal transduction at type A gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors located in brain synapses. The protein is conserved from yeast to mammals, with the most highly conserved domain consisting of seven contiguous residues that constitute the hydrophobic binding site for medium- and long-chain acyl-Coenzyme A esters. Diazepam binding inhibitor is also known to mediate the feedback regulation of pancreatic secretion and the postprandial release of cholecystokinin, in addition to its role as a mediator in corticotropin-dependent adrenal steroidogenesis. Three pseudogenes located on chromosomes 6, 8 and 16 have been identified. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is an oxidoreductase belonging to the copper type II, ascorbate-dependent monooxygenase family. The encoded protein, expressed in neuroscretory vesicles and chromaffin granules of the adrenal medulla, catalyzes the conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine, which functions as both a hormone and as the main neurotransmitter of the sympathetic nervous system. The enzyme encoded by this gene exists exists in both soluble and membrane-bound forms, depending on the absence or presence, respectively, of a signal peptide. Mutations in this gene cause dopamine beta-hydroxylate deficiency in human patients, characterized by deficits in autonomic and cardiovascular function, including hypotension and ptosis. Polymorphisms in this gene may play a role in a variety of psychiatric disorders.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the derlin family. Members of this family participate in the ER-associated degradation response and retrotranslocate misfolded or unfolded proteins from the ER lumen to the cytosol for proteasomal degradation. This protein recognizes substrate in the ER and works in a complex to retrotranslocate it across the ER membrane into the cytosol. This protein may select cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR) for degradation as well as unfolded proteins in Alzheimer's disease. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants that encode different protein isoforms.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a member of the collapsin response mediator protein family. Collapsin response mediator proteins form homo- and hetero-tetramers and facilitate neuron guidance, growth and polarity. The encoded protein promotes microtubule assembly and is required for Sema3A-mediated growth cone collapse, and also plays a role in synaptic signaling through interactions with calcium channels. This gene has been implicated in multiple neurological disorders, and hyperphosphorylation of the encoded protein may play a key role in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the evolutionarily conserved DNAJ/HSP40 family of proteins, which regulate molecular chaperone activity by stimulating ATPase activity. DNAJ proteins may have up to 3 distinct domains: a conserved 70-amino acid J domain, usually at the N terminus; a glycine/phenylalanine (G/F)-rich region; and a cysteine-rich domain containing 4 motifs resembling a zinc finger domain. The product of this gene works as a cochaperone of Hsp70s in protein folding and mitochondrial protein import in vitro.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the DnaJ family of proteins, which act as heat shock protein 70 cochaperones. Heat shock proteins facilitate protein folding, trafficking, prevention of aggregation, and proteolytic degradation. Members of this family are characterized by a highly conserved N-terminal J domain, a glycine/phenylalanine-rich region, four CxxCxGxG zinc finger repeats, and a C-terminal substrate-binding domain. The J domain mediates the interaction with heat shock protein 70 to recruit substrates and regulate ATP hydrolysis activity. In humans, this gene has been implicated in positive regulation of virus replication through co-option by the influenza A virus. Several pseudogenes of this gene are found on other chromosomes.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a TBP- (TATA box-binding protein) associated phosphoprotein that represses both basal and activated levels of transcription. The encoded protein is phosphorylated in vivo and this phosphorylation affects its interaction with TBP. This protein contains a histone fold motif at the amino terminus, a TBP-binding domain, and a glutamine- and alanine-rich region. The binding of DR1 repressor complexes to TBP-promoter complexes may establish a mechanism in which an altered DNA conformation, together with the formation of higher order complexes, inhibits the assembly of the preinitiation complex and controls the rate of RNA polymerase II transcription.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the iodothyronine deiodinase family. It catalyzes the activation, as well as the inactivation of thyroid hormone by outer and inner ring deiodination, respectively. The activation reaction involves the conversion of the prohormone thyroxine (3,5,3',5'-tetraiodothyronine, T4), secreted by the thyroid gland, to the bioactive thyroid hormone (3,5,3'-triiodothyronine, T3) by 5'-deiodination. This protein provides most of the circulating T3, which is essential for growth, differentiation and basal metabolism in vertebrates. This protein is a selenoprotein, containing the rare amino acid selenocysteine (Sec) at its active site. Sec is encoded by the UGA codon, which normally signals translation termination. The 3' UTRs of selenoprotein mRNAs contain a conserved stem-loop structure, designated the Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element, that is necessary for the recognition of UGA as a Sec codon, rather than as a stop signal. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the iodothyronine deiodinase family. It catalyzes the conversion of prohormone thyroxine (3,5,3',5'-tetraiodothyronine, T4) to the bioactive thyroid hormone (3,5,3'-triiodothyronine, T3) by outer ring 5'-deiodination. This gene is widely expressed, including in thyroid and brain. It is thought to be responsible for the 'local' production of T3, and thus important in influencing thyroid hormone action in these tissues. It has also been reported to be highly expressed in thyroids of patients with Graves disease, and in follicular adenomas. The intrathyroidal T4 to T3 conversion by this enzyme may contribute significantly to the relative increase in thyroidal T3 production in these patients. This protein is a selenoprotein containing the non-standard amino acid, selenocysteine (Sec), which is encoded by the UGA codon that normally signals translation termination. The 3' UTRs of selenoprotein mRNAs contain a conserved stem-loop structure, designated the Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element, that is necessary for the recognition of UGA as a Sec codon, rather than as a stop signal. Unlike the other two members (DIO1 and DIO3) of this enzyme family, the mRNA for this gene contains an additional in-frame UGA codon that has been reported (in human) to function either as a Sec or a stop codon, which can result in two isoforms with one or two Sec residues; however, only the upstream Sec (conserved with the single Sec residue found at the active site in DIO1 and DIO3) was shown to be essential for enzyme activity (PMID:10403186). Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this intronless gene belongs to the iodothyronine deiodinase family. It catalyzes the inactivation of thyroid hormone by inner ring deiodination of the prohormone thyroxine (T4) and the bioactive hormone 3,3',5-triiodothyronine (T3) to inactive metabolites, 3,3',5'-triiodothyronine (RT3) and 3,3'-diiodothyronine (T2), respectively. This enzyme is highly expressed in pregnant uterus, placenta, fetal and neonatal tissues, and thought to prevent premature exposure of developing fetal tissues to adult levels of thyroid hormones. It regulates circulating fetal thyroid hormone concentrations, and thus plays a critical role in mammalian development. Knockout mice lacking this gene exhibit abnormalities related to development and reproduction, and increased activity of this enzyme in infants with hemangiomas causes severe hypothyroidism. This protein is a selenoprotein, containing the rare selenocysteine (Sec) amino acid at its active site. Sec is encoded by the UGA codon, which normally signals translation termination. The 3' UTRs of selenoprotein mRNAs contain a conserved stem-loop structure, designated the Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element, that is necessary for the recognition of UGA as a Sec codon rather than as a stop signal.","Variant counts

Summary
Cell motility, adhesion, cytokinesis, and other functions of the cell cortex are mediated by reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and several formin homology (FH) proteins have been associated with these processes. The protein encoded by this gene contains two FH domains and belongs to a novel FH protein subfamily implicated in cell polarity. A key regulator of cytoskeletal architecture, the small GTPase Rho, is activated during development by Wnt/Fz signaling to control cell polarity and movement. The protein encoded by this gene is thought to function as a scaffolding protein for the Wnt-induced assembly of a disheveled (Dvl)-Rho complex. This protein also promotes the nucleation and elongation of new actin filaments and regulates cell growth through the stabilization of microtubules. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct proteins.","Variant counts

Summary
DEAD box proteins, characterized by the conserved motif Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD), are putative RNA helicases. They are implicated in a number of cellular processes involving alteration of RNA secondary structure, such as translation initiation, nuclear and mitochondrial splicing, and ribosome and spliceosome assembly. Based on their distribution patterns, some members of the DEAD box protein family are believed to be involved in embryogenesis, spermatogenesis, and cellular growth and division. This gene encodes a member of this family. The encoded protein is a gonadotropin-regulated and developmentally expressed testicular RNA helicase. It may serve to maintain testicular functions related to steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a multifunctional protein that resides in multiple locations in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm. It interacts with a wide variety of proteins, such as apoptosis antigen Fas, centromere protein C, and transcription factor erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog 1. In the nucleus, the encoded protein functions as a potent transcription repressor that binds to sumoylated transcription factors. Its repression can be relieved by the sequestration of this protein into promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies or nucleoli. This protein also associates with centromeres in G2 phase. In the cytoplasm, the encoded protein may function to regulate apoptosis. The subcellular localization and function of this protein are modulated by post-translational modifications, including sumoylation, phosphorylation and polyubiquitination. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a nuclear factor that is involved in the maintenance of pluripotency in stem cells and essential for embryogenesis. The encoded protein has a scaffold-attachment factor A/B, acinus and PIAS (SAP) domain that binds DNA and is thought to modify chromatin. Mice with a homozygous knockout of the orthologous gene die during late embryonic development or within hours after birth. Knockout embryos are normal in size at embryonic day 18.5 but exhibit skeletal and lung tissue abnormalities. This gene, when mutated, is highly expressed in embryonal carcinomas, pluripotent germ cell tumors, and other cancers and is thought to play an important role in tumor progression. Multiple pseudogenes of this gene have been identified. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
Many vertebrate homeo box-containing genes have been identified on the basis of their sequence similarity with Drosophila developmental genes. Members of the Dlx gene family contain a homeobox that is related to that of Distal-less (Dll), a gene expressed in the head and limbs of the developing fruit fly. The Distal-less (Dlx) family of genes comprises at least 6 different members, DLX1-DLX6. The DLX proteins are postulated to play a role in forebrain and craniofacial development. Three transcript variants have been described for this gene, however, the full length nature of one variant has not been described. Studies of the two splice variants revealed that one encoded isoform functions as a repressor of the beta-globin gene while the other isoform lacks that function.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes component E2 of the multi-enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). PDC resides in the inner mitochondrial membrane and catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl coenzyme A. The protein product of this gene, dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase, accepts acetyl groups formed by the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate and transfers them to coenzyme A. Dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase is the antigen for antimitochondrial antibodies. These autoantibodies are present in nearly 95% of patients with the autoimmune liver disease primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). In PBC, activated T lymphocytes attack and destroy epithelial cells in the bile duct where this protein is abnormally distributed and overexpressed. PBC enventually leads to cirrhosis and liver failure. Mutations in this gene are also a cause of pyruvate dehydrogenase E2 deficiency which causes primary lactic acidosis in infancy and early childhood.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the CDM protein family. It is specifically expressed in hematopoietic cells and is predominantly expressed in peripheral blood leukocytes. The protein is involved in remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton required for lymphocyte migration in response to chemokine signaling. It activates members of the Rho family of GTPases, for example RAC1 and RAC2, by acting as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) to exchange bound GDP for free GTP. Mutations in this gene result in immunodeficiency 40 (IMD40), a combined form of immunodeficiency that affects T cell number and function, also with variable defects in B cell and NK cell function.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is specifically expressed in the central nervous system (CNS). It encodes a member of the DOCK (dedicator of cytokinesis) family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). This protein, dedicator of cytokinesis 3 (DOCK3), is also known as modifier of cell adhesion (MOCA) and presenilin-binding protein (PBP). The DOCK3 and DOCK1, -2 and -4 share several conserved amino acids in their DHR-2 (DOCK homology region 2) domains that are required for GEF activity, and bind directly to WAVE proteins [Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) family Verprolin-homologous proteins] via their DHR-1 domains. The DOCK3 induces axonal outgrowth in CNS by stimulating membrane recruitment of the WAVE complex and activating the small G protein Rac1. This gene is associated with an attention deficit hyperactivity disorder-like phenotype by a complex chromosomal rearrangement.","Variant counts

This protein catalyzes the conversion of GDP to GTP and thereby converts inactive GDP-bound Rab proteins into their active GTP-bound form. The encoded protein is recruited by RAB6 onto Golgi membranes and is therefore referred to as RAB6-interacting protein 1. This protein binds with RAB39 as well. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms. Mutations in this gene are associated with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy-49.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the dynamin superfamily of GTPases. The encoded protein mediates mitochondrial and peroxisomal division, and is involved in developmentally regulated apoptosis and programmed necrosis. Dysfunction of this gene is implicated in several neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease. Mutations in this gene are associated with the autosomal dominant disorder, encephalopathy, lethal, due to defective mitochondrial and peroxisomal fission (EMPF). Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
Transcriptional repression is a general mechanism for regulating transcriptional initiation in organisms ranging from yeast to humans. Accurate initiation of transcription from eukaryotic protein-encoding genes requires the assembly of a large multiprotein complex consisting of RNA polymerase II and general transcription factors such as TFIIA, TFIIB, and TFIID. DR1 is a repressor that interacts with the TATA-binding protein (TBP) of TFIID and prevents the formation of an active transcription complex by precluding the entry of TFIIA and/or TFIIB into the preinitiation complex. The protein encoded by this gene is a corepressor of transcription that interacts with DR1 to enhance DR1-mediated repression. The interaction between this corepressor and DR1 is required for corepressor function and appears to stabilize the TBP-DR1-DNA complex.","Variant counts

Dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) constitute a large heterogeneous subgroup of the type I cysteine-based protein-tyrosine phosphatase superfamily. DUSPs are characterized by their ability to dephosphorylate both tyrosine and serine/threonine residues. They have been implicated as major modulators of critical signaling pathways. DUSP19 contains a variation of the consensus DUSP C-terminal catalytic domain, with the last serine residue replaced by alanine, and lacks the N-terminal CH2 domain found in the MKP (mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase) class of DUSPs (see MIM 600714) (summary by Patterson et al., 2009 [PubMed 19228121]).","Variant counts

They negatively regulate members of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase superfamily (MAPK/ERK, SAPK/JNK, p38), which is associated with cellular proliferation and differentiation. Different members of the family of dual specificity phosphatases show distinct substrate specificities for various MAP kinases, different tissue distribution and subcellular localization, and different modes of inducibility of their expression by extracellular stimuli. This gene product is localized to the nucleus and binds directly to RNA and splicing factors, and thus it is suggested to participate in nuclear mRNA metabolism.","Variant counts

Summary
A similar gene has been characterized in mice and encodes dolichyl pyrophosphate (Dol-P-P) phosphatase. This protein dephosphorylates dolichyl pyrophosphate so that it may be re-utilized as a glycosyl carrier lipid by the oligosaccharyltransferase multisubunit complex in the ER. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants and protein isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the membrane fatty acid desaturase family which is responsible for inserting double bonds into specific positions in fatty acids. This protein contains three His-containing consensus motifs that are characteristic of a group of membrane fatty acid desaturases. It is predicted to be a multiple membrane-spanning protein localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. Overexpression of this gene inhibited biosynthesis of the EGF receptor, suggesting a possible role of a fatty acid desaturase in regulating biosynthetic processing of the EGF receptor.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a subunit of several, distinct complexes involved in the repression or activation of transcription. The encoded protein can independently repress transcription and is targeted to replication foci throughout S phase by interacting directly with the N-terminus of DNA methyltransferase 1. During late S phase, histone deacetylase 2 is added to this complex, providing a means to deacetylate histones in transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin following replication. The encoded protein is also a component of the nucleosome acetyltransferase of H4 complex and interacts with the transcriptional corepressor tumor susceptibility gene 101 and the pro-apoptotic death-associated protein 6, among others. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein have been described.","Variant counts

This gene is one of two genes which encode a protein similar to the Drosophila protein dachshund, a transcription factor involved in cell fate determination in the eye, limb and genital disc of the fly. The encoded protein contains two characteristic dachshund domains: an N-terminal domain responsible for DNA binding and a C-terminal domain responsible for protein-protein interactions. This gene is located on the X chromosome and is subject to inactivation by DNA methylation. The encoded protein may be involved in regulation of organogenesis and myogenesis, and may play a role in premature ovarian failure. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that is necessary for the repair of ultraviolet light-damaged DNA. This protein is the smaller subunit of a heterodimeric protein complex that participates in nucleotide excision repair, and this complex mediates the ubiquitylation of histones H3 and H4, which facilitates the cellular response to DNA damage. This subunit appears to be required for DNA binding. Mutations in this gene cause xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group E, a recessive disease that is characterized by an increased sensitivity to UV light and a high predisposition for skin cancer development, in some cases accompanied by neurological abnormalities. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is the large subunit (p127) of the heterodimeric DNA damage-binding (DDB) complex while another protein (p48) forms the small subunit. This protein complex functions in nucleotide-excision repair and binds to DNA following UV damage. Defective activity of this complex causes the repair defect in patients with xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group E (XPE) - an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by photosensitivity and early onset of carcinomas. However, it remains for mutation analysis to demonstrate whether the defect in XPE patients is in this gene or the gene encoding the small subunit. In addition, Best vitelliform mascular dystrophy is mapped to the same region as this gene on 11q, but no sequence alternations of this gene are demonstrated in Best disease patients. The protein encoded by this gene also functions as an adaptor molecule for the cullin 4 (CUL4) ubiquitin E3 ligase complex by facilitating the binding of substrates to this complex and the ubiquitination of proteins.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that contains a death effector domain (DED). DED is a protein-protein interaction domain shared by adaptors, regulators and executors of the programmed cell death pathway. Overexpression of this gene was shown to induce weak apoptosis. Upon stimulation, this protein was found to translocate from cytoplasm to nucleus and colocalize with UBTF, a basal factor required for RNA polymerase I transcription, in the nucleolus. At least three transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the Dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase (DYRK) family. This member contains a nuclear targeting signal sequence, a protein kinase domain, a leucine zipper motif, and a highly conservative 13-consecutive-histidine repeat. It catalyzes its autophosphorylation on serine/threonine and tyrosine residues. It may play a significant role in a signaling pathway regulating cell proliferation and may be involved in brain development. This gene is a homolog of Drosophila mnb (minibrain) gene and rat Dyrk gene. It is localized in the Down syndrome critical region of chromosome 21, and is considered to be a strong candidate gene for learning defects associated with Down syndrome. Alternative splicing of this gene generates several transcript variants differing from each other either in the 5' UTR or in the 3' coding region. These variants encode at least five different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
Dynamins represent one of the subfamilies of GTP-binding proteins. These proteins share considerable sequence similarity over the N-terminal portion of the molecule, which contains the GTPase domain. Dynamins are associated with microtubules. They have been implicated in cell processes such as endocytosis and cell motility, and in alterations of the membrane that accompany certain activities such as bone resorption by osteoclasts. Dynamins bind many proteins that bind actin and other cytoskeletal proteins. Dynamins can also self-assemble, a process that stimulates GTPase activity. Five alternatively spliced transcripts encoding different proteins have been described. Additional alternatively spliced transcripts may exist, but their full-length nature has not been determined.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a DNA methyltransferase which is thought to function in de novo methylation, rather than maintenance methylation. The protein localizes primarily to the nucleus and its expression is developmentally regulated. Mutations in this gene cause the immunodeficiency-centromeric instability-facial anomalies (ICF) syndrome. Eight alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described.

Summary
CpG methylation is an epigenetic modification that is important for embryonic development, imprinting, and X-chromosome inactivation. Studies in mice have demonstrated that DNA methylation is required for mammalian development. This gene encodes a nuclear protein with similarity to DNA methyltransferases, but is not thought to function as a DNA methyltransferase as it does not contain the amino acid residues necessary for methyltransferase activity. However, it does stimulate de novo methylation by DNA cytosine methyltransferase 3 alpha and is thought to be required for the establishment of maternal genomic imprints. This protein also mediates transcriptional repression through interaction with histone deacetylase 1. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
DEAD box proteins, characterized by the conserved motif Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD), are putative RNA helicases. They are implicated in a number of cellular processes involving alteration of RNA secondary structure, such as translation initiation, nuclear and mitochondrial splicing, and ribosome and spliceosome assembly. Based on their distribution patterns, some members of the DEAD box protein family are believed to be involved in embryogenesis, spermatogenesis, and cellular growth and division. The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the DEAD box protein family and interacts with several spliceosomal proteins. In addition, the encoded protein may recognize the bacterial second messengers cyclic di-GMP and cyclic di-AMP, resulting in the induction of genes involved in the innate immune response.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the dynein intermediate chain family. The encoded protein is part of the dynein complex in respiratory cilia. The inner- and outer-arm dyneins, which bridge between the doublet microtubules in axonemes, are the force-generating proteins responsible for the sliding movement in axonemes. The intermediate and light chains, thought to form the base of the dynein arm, help mediate attachment and may also participate in regulating dynein activity. Mutations in this gene result in abnormal ciliary ultrastructure and function associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia and Kartagener syndrome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the DExD/H-box helicase family of proteins, a subset of the super family 2 helicases. Members of the DExD/H-box helicase family share a conserved functional core comprised of two RecA-like globular domains. These domains contain conserved motifs that mediate ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis, nucleic acid binding, and RNA unwinding. In addition to functions in RNA metabolism, members of this family are involved in anti-viral immunity and act as cytosolic sensors of viral nucleic acids. The protein encoded by this gene has been shown to inhibit hepatitis C virus replication in response to interferon stimulation in cell culture. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a serine-threonine kinase that is closely related to other kinases that interact with members of the Rho family of small GTPases. Substrates for this enzyme include myogenin, the beta-subunit of the L-type calcium channels, and phospholemman. The 3' untranslated region of this gene contains 5-38 copies of a CTG trinucleotide repeat. Expansion of this unstable motif to 50-5,000 copies causes myotonic dystrophy type I, which increases in severity with increasing repeat element copy number. Repeat expansion is associated with condensation of local chromatin structure that disrupts the expression of genes in this region. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been described, but the full-length nature of some of these variants has not been determined.","Variant counts

Summary
Dentin matrix acidic phosphoprotein is an extracellular matrix protein and a member of the small integrin binding ligand N-linked glycoprotein family. This protein, which is critical for proper mineralization of bone and dentin, is present in diverse cells of bone and tooth tissues. The protein contains a large number of acidic domains, multiple phosphorylation sites, a functional arg-gly-asp cell attachment sequence, and a DNA binding domain. In undifferentiated osteoblasts it is primarily a nuclear protein that regulates the expression of osteoblast-specific genes. During osteoblast maturation the protein becomes phosphorylated and is exported to the extracellular matrix, where it orchestrates mineralized matrix formation. Mutations in the gene are known to cause autosomal recessive hypophosphatemia, a disease that manifests as rickets and osteomalacia. The gene structure is conserved in mammals. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a transcription factor that contains a cyclin D-binding domain, three central Myb-like repeats, and two flanking acidic transactivation domains at the N- and C-termini. The encoded protein is induced by the oncogenic Ras signaling pathway and functions as a tumor suppressor by activating the transcription of ARF and thus the ARF-p53 pathway to arrest cell growth or induce apoptosis. It also activates the transcription of aminopeptidase N and may play a role in hematopoietic cell differentiation. The transcriptional activity of this protein is regulated by binding of D-cyclins. This gene is hemizygously deleted in approximately 40% of human non-small-cell lung cancer and is a potential prognostic and gene-therapy target for non-small-cell lung cancer. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes the peroxisomal enzyme D-amino acid oxidase. The enzyme is a flavoprotein which uses flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) as its prosthetic group. Its substrates include a wide variety of D-amino acids, but it is inactive on the naturally occurring L-amino acids. Its biological function is not known; it may act as a detoxifying agent which removes D-amino acids that accumulate during aging. In mice, it degrades D-serine, a co-agonist of the NMDA receptor. This gene may play a role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the IML1 family of proteins involved in G-protein signaling pathways. The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway regulates cell growth by sensing the availability of nutrients. The protein encoded by this gene is a component of the GATOR1 (GAP activity toward Rags) complex which inhibits the amino acid-sensing branch of the mTORC1 pathway. Mutations in this gene are associated with autosomal dominant familial focal epilepsy with variable foci. A single nucleotide polymorphism in an intron of this gene has been associated with an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in individuals with chronic hepatitis C virus infection. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a single-pass type II membrane protein that is a member of the S9B family in clan SC of the serine proteases. This protein has no detectable protease activity, most likely due to the absence of the conserved serine residue normally present in the catalytic domain of serine proteases. However, it does bind specific voltage-gated potassium channels and alters their expression and biophysical properties. Mutations in this gene have been associated with asthma. Alternate transcriptional splice variants, encoding different isoforms, have been characterized.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein which regulates Golgi-associated secretory pathways that are essential to endochondral bone formation during early development. This gene is also believed to play a role in early brain development. This gene is widely expressed in embryos and is particularly abundant in chodrocytes and brain tissues. It encodes a peripheral membrane protein which shuttles between the cytosol and Golgi complex. Mutations in this gene are associated with two types of recessive osteochondrodysplasia: Dyggve-Melchior-Clausen (DMC) dysplasia and Smith-McCort (SMC) dysplasia.","Variant counts

Defensins form a family of antimicrobial and cytotoxic peptides made by neutrophils. Defensins are short, processed peptide molecules that are classified by structure into three groups: alpha-defensins, beta-defensins and theta-defensins. All beta-defensin genes are densely clustered in four to five syntenic chromosomal regions. Chromosome 8p23 contains at least two copies of the duplicated beta-defensin cluster. This duplication results in two identical copies of defensin, beta 104, DEFB104A and DEFB104B, in head-to-head orientation. This gene, DEFB104B, represents the more telomeric copy.","Variant counts

Summary
DVL1, the human homolog of the Drosophila dishevelled gene (dsh) encodes a cytoplasmic phosphoprotein that regulates cell proliferation, acting as a transducer molecule for developmental processes, including segmentation and neuroblast specification. DVL1 is a candidate gene for neuroblastomatous transformation. The Schwartz-Jampel syndrome and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A have been mapped to the same region as DVL1. The phenotypes of these diseases may be consistent with defects which might be expected from aberrant expression of a DVL gene during development.","Variant counts

This gene encodes an enzyme that removes the C(7-8) double bond in the B ring of sterols and catalyzes the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholesterol. This gene is ubiquitously expressed and its transmembrane protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and nuclear outer membrane. Mutations in this gene cause Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS); a syndrome that is metabolically characterized by reduced serum cholesterol levels and elevated serum 7-dehydrocholesterol levels and phenotypically characterized by cognitive disability, facial dysmorphism, syndactyly of second and third toes, and holoprosencephaly in severe cases to minimal physical abnormalities and near-normal intelligence in mild cases.

Summary
DEAD box proteins, characterized by the conserved motif Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD), are putative RNA helicases. They are implicated in a number of cellular processes involving alteration of RNA secondary structure, such as translation initiation, nuclear and mitochondrial splicing, and ribosome and splicesosome assembly. Based on their distribution patterns, some members of this family are believed to be involved in embryogenesis, spermatogenesis, and cellular growth and division. This gene encodes a DEAD box protein, which is an ATPase activated by a variety of RNA species, but not by dsDNA. This protein, and that encoded by DDX5 gene, are more closely related to each other than to any other member of the DEAD box family. This gene can encode multiple isoforms due to both alternative splicing and the use of alternative translation initiation codons, including a non-AUG (CUG) start codon.","Variant counts

Summary
DAD1, the defender against apoptotic cell death, was initially identified as a negative regulator of programmed cell death in the temperature sensitive tsBN7 cell line. The DAD1 protein disappeared in temperature-sensitive cells following a shift to the nonpermissive temperature, suggesting that loss of the DAD1 protein triggered apoptosis. DAD1 is believed to be a tightly associated subunit of oligosaccharyltransferase both in the intact membrane and in the purified enzyme, thus reflecting the essential nature of N-linked glycosylation in eukaryotes.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a transmembrane protein that contains multiple epidermal growth factor repeats that functions as a regulator of cell growth. The encoded protein is involved in the differentiation of several cell types including adipocytes. This gene is located in a region of chromosome 14 frequently showing unparental disomy, and is imprinted and expressed from the paternal allele. A single nucleotide variant in this gene is associated with child and adolescent obesity and shows polar overdominance, where heterozygotes carrying an active paternal allele express the phenotype, while mutant homozygotes are normal.","Variant counts

Dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) constitute a large heterogeneous subgroup of the type I cysteine-based protein-tyrosine phosphatase superfamily. DUSPs are characterized by their ability to dephosphorylate both tyrosine and serine/threonine residues. They have been implicated as major modulators of critical signaling pathways. DUSP18 contains the consensus DUSP C-terminal catalytic domain but lacks the N-terminal CH2 domain found in the MKP (mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase) class of DUSPs (see MIM 600714) (summary by Patterson et al., 2009 [PubMed 19228121]).","Variant counts

Summary
Members of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase superfamily cooperate with protein kinases to regulate cell proliferation and differentiation. This superfamily is separated into two families based on the substrate that is dephosphorylated. One family, the dual specificity phosphatases (DSPs) acts on both phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine/threonine residues. This gene encodes different but related DSP proteins through the use of non-overlapping open reading frames, alternate splicing, and presumed different transcription promoters. Expression of the distinct proteins from this gene has been found to be tissue specific and the proteins may be involved in postnatal development of specific tissues. A protein encoded by the upstream ORF was found in skeletal muscle, whereas the encoded protein from the downstream ORF was found only in testis. In mouse, a similar pattern of expression was found. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants were described, but the full-length sequence of only some were determined.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a calcium-dependent glycoprotein that is a member of the desmocollin subfamily of the cadherin superfamily. These desmosomal family members, along with the desmogleins, are found primarily in epithelial cells where they constitute the adhesive proteins of the desmosome cell-cell junction and are required for cell adhesion and desmosome formation. The desmosomal family members are arranged in two clusters on chromosome 18, occupying less than 650 kb combined. Mutations in this gene are a cause of hypotrichosis and recurrent skin vesicles disorder. The protein can act as an autoantigen in pemphigus diseases, and it is also considered to be a biomarker for some cancers. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the ferlin family and is a skeletal muscle protein found associated with the sarcolemma. It is involved in muscle contraction and contains C2 domains that play a role in calcium-mediated membrane fusion events, suggesting that it may be involved in membrane regeneration and repair. In addition, the protein encoded by this gene binds caveolin-3, a skeletal muscle membrane protein which is important in the formation of caveolae. Specific mutations in this gene have been shown to cause autosomal recessive limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B) as well as Miyoshi myopathy. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is essential for neuromuscular synaptogenesis. The protein functions in aneural activation of muscle-specific receptor kinase, which is required for postsynaptic differentiation, and in the subsequent clustering of the acetylcholine receptor in myotubes. This protein can also induce autophosphorylation of muscle-specific receptor kinase. Mutations in this gene are a cause of familial limb-girdle myasthenia autosomal recessive, which is also known as congenital myasthenic syndrome type 1B. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the DOK family of membrane proteins, which are adapter proteins involved in signal transduction. The encoded protein interacts with phosphorylated receptor tyrosine kinases to mediate neurite outgrowth and activation of the MAP kinase pathway. Unlike other DOK family proteins, this protein does not interact with RASGAP. This protein is up-regulated in patients with systemic sclerosis and is associated with fibrosis induced by insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are encoded by nuclear genes and help in protein synthesis within the mitochondrion. Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) consist of a small 28S subunit and a large 39S subunit. They have an estimated 75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes, where this ratio is reversed. Another difference between mammalian mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain a 5S rRNA. Among different species, the proteins comprising the mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence homology. This gene encodes a 28S subunit protein that also participates in apoptotic pathways which are initiated by tumor necrosis factor-alpha, Fas ligand, and gamma interferon. This protein potentially binds ATP/GTP and might be a functional partner of the mitoribosomal protein S27. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been found for this gene. Pseudogenes corresponding to this gene are found on chromosomes 1q and 2q.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that is a member of the S9B family in clan SC of the serine proteases. The protein has been shown to have post-proline dipeptidyl aminopeptidase activity, cleaving Xaa-Pro dipeptides from the N-termini of proteins. Although the activity of this protein is similar to that of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), it does not appear to be membrane bound. In general, dipeptidyl peptidases appear to be involved in the regulation of the activity of their substrates and have been linked to a variety of diseases including type 2 diabetes, obesity and cancer. Several transcript variants of this gene have been described but not fully characterized.","Variant counts

Summary
The DPP4 gene encodes dipeptidyl peptidase 4, which is identical to adenosine deaminase complexing protein-2, and to the T-cell activation antigen CD26. It is an intrinsic type II transmembrane glycoprotein and a serine exopeptidase that cleaves X-proline dipeptides from the N-terminus of polypeptides. Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 is highly involved in glucose and insulin metabolism, as well as in immune regulation. This protein was shown to be a functional receptor for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and protein modeling suggests that it may play a similar role with SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a single-pass type II membrane protein that is a member of the peptidase S9B family of serine proteases. This protein has no detectable protease activity, most likely due to the absence of the conserved serine residue normally present in the catalytic domain of serine proteases. However, it does bind specific voltage-gated potassium channels and alters their expression and biophysical properties. Variations in this gene may be associated with susceptibility to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and with idiopathic ventricular fibrillation. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the dual specificity protein phosphatase subfamily. These phosphatases inactivate their target kinases by dephosphorylating both the phosphoserine/threonine and phosphotyrosine residues. They negatively regulate members of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase superfamily (MAPK/ERK, SAPK/JNK, p38), which is associated with cellular proliferation and differentiation. Different members of the family of dual specificity phosphatases show distinct substrate specificities for various MAP kinases, different tissue distribution and subcellular localization, and different modes of inducibility of their expression by extracellular stimuli. This gene product shows selectivity for members of the ERK family of MAP kinases and is localized to the cytoplasm and nucleus. Aberrant expression of this gene is associated with type 2 diabetes and cancer progression in several cell types. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
Dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) constitute a large heterogeneous subgroup of the type I cysteine-based protein-tyrosine phosphatase superfamily. DUSPs are characterized by their ability to dephosphorylate both tyrosine and serine/threonine residues. DUSP7 belongs to a class of DUSPs, designated MKPs, that dephosphorylate MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) proteins ERK (see MIM 601795), JNK (see MIM 601158), and p38 (see MIM 600289) with specificity distinct from that of individual MKP proteins. MKPs contain a highly conserved C-terminal catalytic domain and an N-terminal Cdc25 (see MIM 116947)-like (CH2) domain. MAPK activation cascades mediate various physiologic processes, including cellular proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and stress responses (summary by Patterson et al., 2009 [PubMed 19228121]).","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a phosphatase with dual specificity for tyrosine and threonine. The encoded protein can dephosphorylate MAP kinase MAPK1/ERK2, which results in its involvement in several cellular processes. This protein appears to play an important role in the human cellular response to environmental stress as well as in the negative regulation of cellular proliferation. Finally, the encoded protein can make some solid tumors resistant to both chemotherapy and radiotherapy, making it a target for cancer therapy.","Variant counts

Different members of the family of dual specificity phosphatases show distinct substrate specificities for various MAP kinases, different tissue distribution and subcellular localization, and different modes of inducibility of their expression by extracellular stimuli. This gene maps in a region that contains the BRCA1 locus which confers susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer. Although DUSP3 is expressed in both breast and ovarian tissues, mutation screening in breast cancer pedigrees and in sporadic tumors was negative, leading to the conclusion that this gene is not BRCA1.","Variant counts
