Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is an integral membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum. It is a high affinity binding protein for the antiischemic phenylalkylamine Ca2+ antagonist [3H]emopamil and the photoaffinity label [3H]azidopamil. It is similar to sigma receptors and may be a member of a superfamily of high affinity drug-binding proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum of different tissues. This protein shares structural features with bacterial and eukaryontic drug transporting proteins. It has four putative transmembrane segments and contains two conserved glutamate residues which may be involved in the transport of cationic amphiphilics. Another prominent feature of this protein is its high content of aromatic amino acid residues (>23%) in its transmembrane segments. These aromatic amino acid residues have been suggested to be involved in the drug transport by the P-glycoprotein. Mutations in this gene cause Chondrodysplasia punctata 2 (CDPX2; also known as Conradi-Hunermann syndrome).","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes alpha-enolase, one of three enolase isoenzymes found in mammals. Each isoenzyme is a homodimer composed of 2 alpha, 2 gamma, or 2 beta subunits, and functions as a glycolytic enzyme. Alpha-enolase in addition, functions as a structural lens protein (tau-crystallin) in the monomeric form. Alternative splicing of this gene results in a shorter isoform that has been shown to bind to the c-myc promoter and function as a tumor suppressor. Several pseudogenes have been identified, including one on the long arm of chromosome 1. Alpha-enolase has also been identified as an autoantigen in Hashimoto encephalopathy.","Variant counts

This gene belongs to the TBR1 (T-box brain protein 1) sub-family of T-box genes that share the common DNA-binding T-box domain. The encoded protein is a transcription factor which is crucial for embryonic development of mesoderm and the central nervous system in vertebrates. The protein may also be necessary for the differentiation of effector CD8+ T cells which are involved in defense against viral infections. A similar gene disrupted in mice is shown to be essential during trophoblast development and gastrulation. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a histone methyltransferase that methylates the lysine-9 position of histone H3. This action marks the genomic region packaged with these methylated histones for transcriptional repression. This protein may be involved in the silencing of MYC- and E2F-responsive genes and therefore could play a role in the G0/G1 cell cycle transition. Defects in this gene are a cause of chromosome 9q subtelomeric deletion syndrome (9q-syndrome, also known as Kleefstra syndrome). Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a methyltransferase that methylates lysine residues of histone H3. Methylation of H3 at lysine 9 by this protein results in recruitment of additional epigenetic regulators and repression of transcription.

This gene encodes one member of a family of translation repressor proteins. The protein directly interacts with eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), which is a limiting component of the multisubunit complex that recruits 40S ribosomal subunits to the 5' end of mRNAs. Interaction of this protein with eIF4E inhibits complex assembly and represses translation. This protein is phosphorylated in response to various signals including UV irradiation and insulin signaling, resulting in its dissociation from eIF4E and activation of mRNA translation.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the erythroblast transformation-specific (ETS) family of transcriptions factors. All members of this family are key regulators of embryonic development, cell proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis, inflammation, and apoptosis. The protein encoded by this gene is mainly expressed in the nucleus. It contains an ETS DNA-binding domain and a PNT (pointed) domain which is implicated in the self-association of chimeric oncoproteins. This protein is required for platelet adhesion to the subendothelium, inducing vascular cell remodeling. It also regulates hematopoesis, and the differentiation and maturation of megakaryocytic cells. This gene is involved in chromosomal translocations, resulting in different fusion gene products, such as TMPSSR2-ERG and NDRG1-ERG in prostate cancer, EWS-ERG in Ewing's sarcoma and FUS-ERG in acute myeloid leukemia. More than two dozens of transcript variants generated from combinatorial usage of three alternative promoters and multiple alternative splicing events have been reported, but the full-length nature of many of these variants has not been determined.","Variant counts

This gene encodes the protein elongin B, which is a subunit of the transcription factor B (SIII) complex. The SIII complex is composed of elongins A/A2, B and C. It activates elongation by RNA polymerase II by suppressing transient pausing of the polymerase at many sites within transcription units. Elongin A functions as the transcriptionally active component of the SIII complex, whereas elongins B and C are regulatory subunits. Elongin A2 is specifically expressed in the testis, and capable of forming a stable complex with elongins B and C. The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein binds to elongins B and C, and thereby inhibits transcription elongation. Two alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene. Pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes 11 and 13.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes the erythropoietin receptor which is a member of the cytokine receptor family. Upon erythropoietin binding, this receptor activates Jak2 tyrosine kinase which activates different intracellular pathways including: Ras/MAP kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and STAT transcription factors. The stimulated erythropoietin receptor appears to have a role in erythroid cell survival. Defects in the erythropoietin receptor may produce erythroleukemia and familial erythrocytosis. Dysregulation of this gene may affect the growth of certain tumors. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a member of the ephrin receptor subfamily of the protein-tyrosine kinase family. EPH and EPH-related receptors have been implicated in mediating developmental events, particularly in the nervous system. Receptors in the EPH subfamily typically have a single kinase domain and an extracellular region containing a Cys-rich domain and 2 fibronectin type III repeats. The ephrin receptors are divided into 2 groups based on the similarity of their extracellular domain sequences and their affinities for binding ephrin-A and ephrin-B ligands. The protein encoded by this gene functions as a receptor for ephrin A2, A3 and A5 and plays a role in short-range contact-mediated axonal guidance during development of the mammalian nervous system.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene belongs to the ephrin receptor subfamily of the protein-tyrosine kinase family. EPH and EPH-related receptors have been implicated in mediating developmental events, particularly in the nervous system. Receptors in the EPH subfamily typically have a single kinase domain and an extracellular region containing a Cys-rich domain and 2 fibronectin type III repeats. The ephrin receptors are divided into 2 groups based on the similarity of their extracellular domain sequences and their affinities for binding ephrin-A and ephrin-B ligands. This gene encodes a protein that binds ephrin-A ligands. Two alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the EH domain-containing protein family. These proteins are characterized by a C-terminal EF-hand domain, a nucleotide-binding consensus site at the N terminus and a bipartite nuclear localization signal. The encoded protein interacts with the actin cytoskeleton through an N-terminal domain and also binds to an EH domain-binding protein through the C-terminal EH domain. This interaction appears to connect clathrin-dependent endocytosis to actin, suggesting that this gene product participates in the endocytic pathway.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the Polycomb-group (PcG) family. PcG family members form multimeric protein complexes, which are involved in maintaining the transcriptional repressive state of genes over successive cell generations. This protein interacts with enhancer of zeste 2, the cytoplasmic tail of integrin beta7, immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) MA protein, and histone deacetylase proteins. This protein mediates repression of gene activity through histone deacetylation, and may act as a specific regulator of integrin function. Two transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been identified for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the EF-hand super family of calcium binding proteins, which are involved in a variety of cellular processes including mitosis, synaptic transmission, and cytoskeletal rearrangement. The protein encoded by this gene is composed of an N-terminal disordered region, proline-rich elements, two EF-hands, and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain. This protein has been shown to associate with the mitochondrial inner membrane, and in HeLa cells, acts as a novel mitochondrial calcium ion sensor for mitochondrial flash activation. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The product of this gene functions in the nucleotide excision repair pathway, and is required for the repair of DNA lesions such as those induced by UV light or formed by electrophilic compounds including cisplatin. The encoded protein forms a heterodimer with the XPF endonuclease (also known as ERCC4), and the heterodimeric endonuclease catalyzes the 5' incision in the process of excising the DNA lesion. The heterodimeric endonuclease is also involved in recombinational DNA repair and in the repair of inter-strand crosslinks. Mutations in this gene result in cerebrooculofacioskeletal syndrome, and polymorphisms that alter expression of this gene may play a role in carcinogenesis. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. The last exon of this gene overlaps with the CD3e molecule, epsilon associated protein gene on the opposite strand.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a single-strand specific DNA endonuclease that makes the 3' incision in DNA excision repair following UV-induced damage. The protein may also function in other cellular processes, including RNA polymerase II transcription, and transcription-coupled DNA repair. Mutations in this gene cause xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group G (XP-G), which is also referred to as xeroderma pigmentosum VII (XP7), a skin disorder characterized by hypersensitivity to UV light and increased susceptibility for skin cancer development following UV exposure. Some patients also develop Cockayne syndrome, which is characterized by severe growth defects, cognitive disability, and cachexia. Read-through transcription exists between this gene and the neighboring upstream BIVM (basic, immunoglobulin-like variable motif containing) gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a multifunctional protein that is involved in various cellular processes, including gene expression, cell signaling, and RNA processing and transport. The protein includes an N-terminal transcriptional activation domain and a C-terminal RNA-binding domain. Chromosomal translocations between this gene and various genes encoding transcription factors result in the production of chimeric proteins that are involved in tumorigenesis. These chimeric proteins usually consist of the N-terminal transcriptional activation domain of this protein fused to the C-terminal DNA-binding domain of the transcription factor protein. Mutations in this gene, specifically a t(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation, are known to cause Ewing sarcoma as well as neuroectodermal and various other tumors. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants. Related pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes 1 and 14.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a homeobox-containing transcription factor that is the homolog to the 'empty spiracles' gene in Drosophila. Research on this gene in humans has focused on its expression in three tissues: dorsal telencephalon, olfactory neuroepithelium, and urogenetial system. It is expressed in the dorsal telencephalon during development in a low rostral-lateral to high caudal-medial gradient and is proposed to pattern the neocortex into defined functional areas. It is also expressed in embryonic and adult olfactory neuroepithelia where it complexes with eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) and possibly regulates mRNA transport or translation. In the developing urogenital system, it is expressed in epithelial tissues and is negatively regulated by HOXA10. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct proteins.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the hydratase/isomerase superfamily. The gene product shows high sequence similarity to enoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) hydratases of several species, particularly within a conserved domain characteristic of these proteins. The encoded protein, which contains a C-terminal peroxisomal targeting sequence, localizes to the peroxisome. The rat ortholog, which localizes to the matrix of both the peroxisome and mitochondria, can isomerize 3-trans,5-cis-dienoyl-CoA to 2-trans,4-trans-dienoyl-CoA, indicating that it is a delta3,5-delta2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase. This enzyme functions in the auxiliary step of the fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway. Expression of the rat gene is induced by peroxisome proliferators.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the endothelin family. Endothelins are endothelium-derived vasoactive peptides involved in a variety of biological functions. The active form of this protein is a 21 amino acid peptide processed from the precursor protein. The active peptide is a ligand for endothelin receptor type B (EDNRB). The interaction of this endothelin with EDNRB is essential for development of neural crest-derived cell lineages, such as melanocytes and enteric neurons. Mutations in this gene and EDNRB have been associated with Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) and Waardenburg syndrome (WS), which are congenital disorders involving neural crest-derived cells. Altered expression of this gene is implicated in tumorigenesis. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a G protein-coupled receptor which activates a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system. Its ligand, endothelin, consists of a family of three potent vasoactive peptides: ET1, ET2, and ET3. Studies suggest that the multigenic disorder, Hirschsprung disease type 2, is due to mutations in the endothelin receptor type B gene. Alternative splicing and the use of alternative promoters results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that functions in bone formation and skeletal development. Mutations in this gene, as well as in a neighboring gene that lies in a head-to-head configuration, cause Ellis-van Creveld syndrome, an autosomal recessive skeletal dysplasia that is also known as chondroectodermal dysplasia. Mutations in this gene also cause acrofacial dysostosis Weyers type, also referred to as Curry-Hall syndrome, a disease that combines limb and facial abnormalities. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
Elastases form a subfamily of serine proteases that hydrolyze many proteins in addition to elastin. Humans have six elastase genes which encode structurally similar proteins. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate the active protease. Following activation, this protease hydrolyzes proteins within specialized neutrophil lysosomes, called azurophil granules, as well as proteins of the extracellular matrix. The enzyme may play a role in degenerative and inflammatory diseases through proteolysis of collagen-IV and elastin. This protein also degrades the outer membrane protein A (OmpA) of E. coli as well as the virulence factors of such bacteria as Shigella, Salmonella and Yersinia. Mutations in this gene are associated with cyclic neutropenia and severe congenital neutropenia (SCN). This gene is present in a gene cluster on chromosome 19.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a core component of the exosome. The mammalian exosome is required for rapid degradation of AU rich element-containing RNAs but not for poly(A) shortening. The association of this protein with the exosome is mediated by protein-protein interactions with ribosomal RNA-processing protein 42 and ribosomal RNA-processing protein 46. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene product constitutes one of the subunits of the multisubunit particle called exosome, which mediates mRNA degradation. The composition of human exosome is similar to its yeast counterpart. This protein is homologous to the yeast Mtr3 protein. Its exact function is not known, however, it has been shown using a cell-free RNA decay system that the exosome is required for rapid degradation of unstable mRNAs containing AU-rich elements (AREs), but not for poly(A) shortening. The exosome does not recognize ARE-containing mRNAs on its own, but requires ARE-binding proteins that could interact with the exosome and recruit it to unstable mRNAs, thereby promoting their rapid degradation.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a secreted, glycosylated cytokine composed of four alpha helical bundles. The encoded protein is mainly synthesized in the kidney, secreted into the blood plasma, and binds to the erythropoietin receptor to promote red blood cell production, or erythropoiesis, in the bone marrow. Expression of this gene is upregulated under hypoxic conditions, in turn leading to increased erythropoiesis and enhanced oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. Expression of this gene has also been observed in brain and in the eye, and elevated expression levels have been observed in diabetic retinopathy and ocular hypertension. Recombinant forms of the encoded protein exhibit neuroprotective activity against a variety of potential brain injuries, as well as antiapoptotic functions in several tissue types, and have been used in the treatment of anemia and to enhance the efficacy of cancer therapies.","Variant counts

Summary
Eukaryotic translation initiation factor-3 (eIF3), the largest of the eIFs, is a multiprotein complex composed of at least ten nonidentical subunits. The complex binds to the 40S ribosome and helps maintain the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits in a dissociated state. It is also thought to play a role in the formation of the 40S initiation complex by interacting with the ternary complex of eIF2/GTP/methionyl-tRNA, and by promoting mRNA binding. The protein encoded by this gene is the major RNA binding subunit of the eIF3 complex.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF2) family of proteins, and contains a SNF2-like ATPase domain and a PICH family domain. One distinguishing feature of this SWI/SNF protein family member is that during interphase, the protein is excluded from the nucleus, and only associates with chromatin after the nuclear envelope has broken down. This protein is a DNA translocase that is thought to bind double-stranded DNA that is exposed to stretching forces, such as those exerted by the mitotic spindle. This protein associates with ribosomal DNA and ultra-fine DNA bridges (UFBs), fine structures that connect sister chromatids during anaphase at some sites such as fragile sites, telomeres and centromeres. This gene is required for the faithful segregation of sister chromatids during mitosis, and the ATPase activity of this protein required for the resolution of UFBs before cytokinesis.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene catalyzes the post-translational formation of 4-hydroxyproline in hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) alpha proteins. HIF is a transcriptional complex that plays a central role in mammalian oxygen homeostasis. This protein functions as a cellular oxygen sensor, and under normal oxygen concentration, modification by prolyl hydroxylation is a key regulatory event that targets HIF subunits for proteasomal destruction via the von Hippel-Lindau ubiquitylation complex. Mutations in this gene are associated with erythrocytosis familial type 3 (ECYT3).","Variant counts

Testicular sperm are morphologically differentiated but are not progressively motile nor able to fertilize an egg. Post-testicular maturation requires exposure of spermatozoa to the microenvironment of the epididymal lumen. Spermatozoa undergo extensive changes in the epididymis, including enzymatic modifications, loss of pre-existing components and addition of new glycoproteins from epididymal secretions. These modifying proteins and enzymes are synthesized by epithelial cells lining the epididymal duct and secreted apically into the lumen, where they come into contact with, and may be absorbed onto, the sperm membranes. The proteins encoded by the genes in this cluster are synthesized and secreted by epididymal epithelial cells.","Variant counts

Summary
The translation initiation factor EIF2 catalyzes the first regulated step of protein synthesis initiation, promoting the binding of the initiator tRNA to 40S ribosomal subunits. Binding occurs as a ternary complex of methionyl-tRNA, EIF2, and GTP. EIF2 is composed of 3 nonidentical subunits, the 36-kD EIF2-alpha subunit (EIF2S1), the 38-kD EIF2-beta subunit (EIF2S2; MIM 603908), and the 52-kD EIF2-gamma subunit (EIF2S3; MIM 300161). The rate of formation of the ternary complex is modulated by the phosphorylation state of EIF2-alpha (Ernst et al., 1987 [PubMed 2948954]).","Variant counts

Summary
Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (EIF-2) functions in the early steps of protein synthesis by forming a ternary complex with GTP and initiator tRNA and binding to a 40S ribosomal subunit. EIF-2 is composed of three subunits, alpha, beta, and gamma, with the protein encoded by this gene representing the beta subunit. The beta subunit catalyzes the exchange of GDP for GTP, which recycles the EIF-2 complex for another round of initiation. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) is a transcriptional complex that is involved in oxygen homeostasis. At normal oxygen levels, the alpha subunit of HIF is targeted for degration by prolyl hydroxylation. This gene encodes an enzyme responsible for this post-translational modification. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Read-through transcription also exists between this gene and the upstream RAB4B (RAB4B, member RAS oncogene family) gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a component of the exocyst complex, a multi-protein complex essential for the polarized targeting of exocytic vesicles to specific docking sites on the plasma membrane. Though best characterized in yeast, the component proteins and the functions of the exocyst complex have been demonstrated to be highly conserved in higher eukaryotes. At least eight components of the exocyst complex, including this protein, are found to interact with the actin cytoskeletal remodeling and vesicle transport machinery. This interaction has been shown to mediate filopodia formation in fibroblasts. This protein has been shown to interact with the Ral subfamily of GTPases and thereby mediate exocytosis by tethering vesicles to the plasma membrane. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the Eph receptor family of receptor tyrosine kinase transmembrane glycoproteins. These receptors are composed of an N-terminal glycosylated ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane region and an intracellular kinase domain. They bind ligands called ephrins and are involved in diverse cellular processes including motility, division, and differentiation. A distinguishing characteristic of Eph-ephrin signaling is that both receptors and ligands are competent to transduce a signaling cascade, resulting in bidirectional signaling. This protein belongs to a subgroup of the Eph receptors called EphB. Proteins of this subgroup are distinguished from other members of the family by sequence homology and preferential binding affinity for membrane-bound ephrin-B ligands. Allelic variants are associated with prostate and brain cancer susceptibility. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
Ephrin receptors and their ligands, the ephrins, mediate numerous developmental processes, particularly in the nervous system. Based on their structures and sequence relationships, ephrins are divided into the ephrin-A (EFNA) class, which are anchored to the membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage, and the ephrin-B (EFNB) class, which are transmembrane proteins. The Eph family of receptors are divided into two groups based on the similarity of their extracellular domain sequences and their affinities for binding ephrin-A and ephrin-B ligands. Ephrin receptors make up the largest subgroup of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family. This gene encodes a receptor for ephrin-B family members.","Variant counts

Summary
ETFA participates in catalyzing the initial step of the mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation. It shuttles electrons between primary flavoprotein dehydrogenases and the membrane-bound electron transfer flavoprotein ubiquinone oxidoreductase. Defects in electron-transfer-flavoprotein have been implicated in type II glutaricaciduria in which multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiencies result in large excretion of glutaric, lactic, ethylmalonic, butyric, isobutyric, 2-methyl-butyric, and isovaleric acids. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the CAS (CRK-associated substrate) family of adaptor proteins which typically serve as scaffolds for the assembly of larger signaling complexes. These complexes form at the cell surface where integrin binding leads to the subsequent phosphorylation of a CAS protein. Additional binding of SRC family kinases leads to CAS hyperphosphorylation and the creation of binding sites for CRK and other proteins that cause actin cytoskeleton reorganization. This gene plays a role in integrin-mediated cell attachment, spreading, and migration and also plays a role in both normal and malignant cellular transformation. This broadly expressed gene has been shown to play a role in neurite outgrowth and its expression in the thymus and lymphocytes is important for T cell maturation and the development of immunological self-tolerance. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the ETS (E twenty-six) family of transcription factors. The ETS proteins regulate many target genes that modulate biological processes like cell growth, angiogenesis, migration, proliferation and differentiation. All ETS proteins contain an ETS DNA-binding domain that binds to DNA sequences containing the consensus 5'-CGGA[AT]-3'. The protein encoded by this gene contains a conserved short acidic transactivation domain (TAD) in the N-terminal region, in addition to the ETS DNA-binding domain in the C-terminal region. This gene is involved in chromosomal translocations, which result in multiple fusion proteins including EWS-ETV1 in Ewing sarcoma and at least 10 ETV1 partners (see PMID: 19657377, Table 1) in prostate cancer. In addition to chromosomal rearrangement, this gene is overexpressed in prostate cancer, melanoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes the protein elongin C, which is a subunit of the transcription factor B (SIII) complex. The SIII complex is composed of elongins A/A2, B and C. It activates elongation by RNA polymerase II by suppressing transient pausing of the polymerase at many sites within transcription units. Elongin A functions as the transcriptionally active component of the SIII complex, whereas elongins B and C are regulatory subunits. Elongin A2 is specifically expressed in the testis, and capable of forming a stable complex with elongins B and C. The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein binds to elongins B and C, and thereby inhibits transcription elongation. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding two distinct isoforms have been identified.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that is one of the two components of elastic fibers. Elastic fibers comprise part of the extracellular matrix and confer elasticity to organs and tissues including the heart, skin, lungs, ligaments, and blood vessels. The encoded protein is rich in hydrophobic amino acids such as glycine and proline, which form mobile hydrophobic regions bounded by crosslinks between lysine residues. Degradation products of the encoded protein, known as elastin-derived peptides or elastokines, bind the elastin receptor complex and other receptors and stimulate migration and proliferation of monocytes and skin fibroblasts. Elastokines can also contribute to cancer progression. Deletions and mutations in this gene are associated with supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) and autosomal dominant cutis laxa.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a dual-specificity phosphatase and may be involved in the regulation of glycogen metabolism. The protein acts on complex carbohydrates to prevent glycogen hyperphosphorylation, thus avoiding the formation of insoluble aggregates. Loss-of-function mutations in this gene have been associated with Lafora disease, a rare, adult-onset recessive neurodegenerative disease, which results in myoclonus epilepsy and usually results in death several years after the onset of symptoms. The disease is characterized by the accumulation of insoluble particles called Lafora bodies, which are derived from glycogen.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to a highly conserved cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein (ARPP) family. This protein was identified as an endogenous ligand for the sulfonylurea receptor, ABCC8/SUR1. ABCC8 is the regulatory subunit of the ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel, which is located on the plasma membrane of pancreatic beta cells and plays a key role in the control of insulin release from pancreatic beta cells. This protein is thought to be an endogenous regulator of KATP channels. In vitro studies have demonstrated that this protein modulates insulin secretion through the interaction with KATP channel, and this gene has been proposed as a candidate gene for type 2 diabetes. At least eight alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been observed.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the ETS-domain transcription factor family and the ternary complex factor (TCF) subfamily. Proteins in this subfamily regulate transcription when recruited by serum response factor to bind to serum response elements. This protein is activated by signal-induced phosphorylation; studies in rodents suggest that it is a transcriptional inhibitor in the absence of Ras, but activates transcription when Ras is present. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is thought to be part of the eIF4F protein complex, which is involved in mRNA cap recognition and transport of mRNAs to the ribosome. Interestingly, a microRNA (miR-520c-3p) has been found that negatively regulates synthesis of the encoded protein, and this leads to a global decrease in protein translation and cell proliferation. Therefore, this protein is a key component of the anti-tumor activity of miR-520c-3p.","Variant counts

Summary
Translation initiation is mediated by specific recognition of the cap structure by eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4F), which is a cap binding protein complex that consists of three subunits: eIF4A, eIF4E and eIF4G. The protein encoded by this gene shares similarity with the C-terminal region of eIF4G that contains the binding sites for eIF4A and eIF3; eIF4G, in addition, contains a binding site for eIF4E at the N-terminus. Unlike eIF4G, which supports cap-dependent and independent translation, this gene product functions as a general repressor of translation by forming translationally inactive complexes. In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that translation of this mRNA initiates exclusively at a non-AUG (GUG) codon. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms of this gene have been described.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a component of the multi-subunit protein complex EIF4F. This complex facilitates the recruitment of mRNA to the ribosome, which is a rate-limiting step during the initiation phase of protein synthesis. The recognition of the mRNA cap and the ATP-dependent unwinding of 5'-terminal secondary structure is catalyzed by factors in this complex. The subunit encoded by this gene is a large scaffolding protein that contains binding sites for other members of the EIF4F complex. A domain at its N-terminus can also interact with the poly(A)-binding protein, which may mediate the circularization of mRNA during translation. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, some of which are derived from alternative promoter usage.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a multifunctional protein that localizes to both the cytoplasm and nucleus. In the cytoplasm, the encoded protein is an auxiliary component of the macromolecular aminoacyl-tRNA synthase complex. However, its mouse homolog has been shown to translocate to the nucleus in response to DNA damage, and it plays a positive role in ATM/ATR-mediated p53 activation. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Read-through transcription also exists between this gene and the neighboring downstream MUTED (muted homolog) gene. An EEF1E1-related pseudogene has been identified on chromosome 2.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes the transcriptionally active subunit of the SIII (or elongin) transcription elongation factor complex, which also includes two regulatory subunits, elongins B and C. This complex acts to increase the rate of RNA chain elongation by RNA polymerase II by suppressing transient pausing of the polymerase at many sites along the DNA template. Whereas a related protein with similar function, elongin A, is ubiquitously expressed, the encoded protein is specifically expressed in the testis, suggesting it may have a role in spermatogenesis.","Variant counts

Summary
Hemidesmosomes are structures which link the basal lamina to the intermediate filament cytoskeleton. An important functional component of hemidesmosomes is the integrin beta-4 subunit (ITGB4), a protein containing two fibronectin type III domains. The protein encoded by this gene binds to the fibronectin type III domains of ITGB4 and may help link ITGB4 to the intermediate filament cytoskeleton. The encoded protein, which is insoluble and found both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm, can function as a translation initiation factor and prevent the association of the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits. Multiple non-protein coding transcript variants and variants encoding two different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes the adenovirus E1A-associated cellular p300 transcriptional co-activator protein. It functions as histone acetyltransferase that regulates transcription via chromatin remodeling and is important in the processes of cell proliferation and differentiation. It mediates cAMP-gene regulation by binding specifically to phosphorylated CREB protein. This gene has also been identified as a co-activator of HIF1A (hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha), and thus plays a role in the stimulation of hypoxia-induced genes such as VEGF. Defects in this gene are a cause of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome and may also play a role in epithelial cancer.","Variant counts

Summary
Human echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like is a strong candidate for the Usher syndrome type 1A gene. Usher syndromes (USHs) are a group of genetic disorders consisting of congenital deafness, retinitis pigmentosa, and vestibular dysfunction of variable onset and severity depending on the genetic type. The disease process in USHs involves the entire brain and is not limited to the posterior fossa or auditory and visual systems. The USHs are catagorized as type I (USH1A, USH1B, USH1C, USH1D, USH1E and USH1F), type II (USH2A and USH2B) and type III (USH3). The type I is the most severe form. Gene loci responsible for these three types are all mapped. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Accurate initiation of translation in eukaryotes is complex and requires many factors, some of which are composed of multiple subunits. The process is simpler in prokaryotes which have only three initiation factors (IF1, IF2, IF3). Two of these factors are conserved in eukaryotes: the homolog of IF1 is eIF1A and the homolog of IF2 is eIF5B. This gene encodes eIF5B. Factors eIF1A and eIF5B interact on the ribosome along with other initiation factors and GTP to position the initiation methionine tRNA on the start codon of the mRNA so that translation initiates accurately.","Variant counts

Summary
Ephrin-A5, a member of the ephrin gene family, prevents axon bundling in cocultures of cortical neurons with astrocytes, a model of late stage nervous system development and differentiation. The EPH and EPH-related receptors comprise the largest subfamily of receptor protein-tyrosine kinases and have been implicated in mediating developmental events, particularly in the nervous system. EPH receptors typically have a single kinase domain and an extracellular region containing a Cys-rich domain and 2 fibronectin type III repeats. The ephrin ligands and receptors have been named by the Eph Nomenclature Committee (1997). Based on their structures and sequence relationships, ephrins are divided into the ephrin-A (EFNA) class, which are anchored to the membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage, and the ephrin-B (EFNB) class, which are transmembrane proteins.

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the ephrin (EPH) family. The ephrins and EPH-related receptors comprise the largest subfamily of receptor protein-tyrosine kinases and have been implicated in mediating developmental events, especially in the nervous system and in erythropoiesis. Based on their structures and sequence relationships, ephrins are divided into the ephrin-A (EFNA) class, which are anchored to the membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage, and the ephrin-B (EFNB) class, which are transmembrane proteins. This gene encodes an EFNA class ephrin. Three transcript variants that encode distinct proteins have been identified.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a dual-function 65 kDa protein that undergoes proteolytic cleavage to produce a 45 kDa N-terminal fragment with a paired-like homeodomain and a 20 kDa C-terminal fragment with a proline-rich domain. The C-terminal fragment localizes to the cytoplasm while the N-terminal fragment localizes exclusively to the nucleus. In contrast to human, the mouse homolog has a novel PN/PF motif in the C-terminus and is paternally imprinted in placental tissue. This gene likely plays a role in placental development and spermatogenesis.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes the transmembrane protein kinase inositol-requiring enzyme 1. The encoded protein contains two functional catalytic domains, a serine/threonine-protein kinase domain and an endoribonuclease domain. This protein functions as a sensor of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and triggers an intracellular signaling pathway termed the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR is an ER stress response that is conserved from yeast to mammals and activates genes involved in degrading misfolded proteins, regulating protein synthesis and activating molecular chaperones. This protein specifically mediates the splicing and activation of the stress response transcription factor X-box binding protein 1.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes an epididymal protease inhibitor, which contains both kunitz-type and WAP-type four-disulfide core (WFDC) protease inhibitor consensus sequences. Most WFDC genes are localized to chromosome 20q12-q13 in two clusters: centromeric and telomeric. This gene is a member of the WFDC gene family and belongs to the telomeric cluster. The protein can inhibit human sperm motility and exhibits antimicrobial activity against E. coli, and polymorphisms in this gene are associated with male infertility. Read-through transcription also exists between this gene and the downstream WFDC6 (WAP four-disulfide core domain 6) gene. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

This gene belongs to a highly conserved gene family encoding EPS15 homology (EH) domain-containing proteins. The protein-binding EH domain was first noted in EPS15, a substrate for the epidermal growth factor receptor.

Summary
The zinc finger protein encoded by this gene is one of several cellular transcription factors whose DNA-binding activities are regulated through the action of adenovirus E1A. A 50-kDa amino-terminal product is generated from the full-length protein through proteolytic cleavage. The protein is differentially regulated by E1A-induced phosphorylation. The full-length gene product represses transcription from the E4 promoter in the absence of E1A, while the 50-kDa form acts as a transcriptional activator in its presence. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcripts encoding different proteins.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the estrogen receptor-related receptor (ESRR) family, which belongs to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. All members of the ESRR family share an almost identical DNA binding domain, which is composed of two C4-type zinc finger motifs. The ESRR members are orphan nuclear receptors; they bind to the estrogen response element and steroidogenic factor 1 response element, and activate genes controlled by both response elements in the absence of any ligands. The ESRR family is closely related to the estrogen receptor (ER) family. They share target genes, co-regulators and promoters, and by targeting the same set of genes, the ESRRs seem to interfere with the ER-mediated estrogen response in various ways. It has been reported that the family member encoded by this gene functions as a transcriptional activator of DNA cytosine-5-methyltransferases 1 (Dnmt1) expression by direct binding to its response elements in the DNMT1 promoters, modulates cell proliferation and estrogen signaling in breast cancer, and negatively regulates bone morphogenetic protein 2-induced osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been identified, which mainly differ at the 5' end and some of which encode protein isoforms differing in the N-terminal region.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor and transforming protein that is related to Rho-specific exchange factors and yeast cell cycle regulators. The expression of this gene is elevated with the onset of DNA synthesis and remains elevated during G2 and M phases. In situ hybridization analysis showed that expression is at a high level in cells undergoing mitosis in regenerating liver. Thus, this protein is expressed in a cell cycle-dependent manner during liver regeneration, and is thought to have an important role in the regulation of cytokinesis. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene functions as both a phosphodiesterase, which cleaves phosphodiester bonds at the 5' end of oligonucleotides, and a phospholipase, which catalyzes production of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) in extracellular fluids. LPA evokes growth factor-like responses including stimulation of cell proliferation and chemotaxis. This gene product stimulates the motility of tumor cells and has angiogenic properties, and its expression is upregulated in several kinds of carcinomas. The gene product is secreted and further processed to make the biologically active form. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase (ENPP) family. The encoded protein is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein comprising two identical disulfide-bonded subunits. This protein has broad specificity and cleaves a variety of substrates, including phosphodiester bonds of nucleotides and nucleotide sugars and pyrophosphate bonds of nucleotides and nucleotide sugars. This protein may function to hydrolyze nucleoside 5' triphosphates to their corresponding monophosphates and may also hydrolyze diadenosine polyphosphates. Mutations in this gene have been associated with 'idiopathic' infantile arterial calcification, ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament of the spine (OPLL), and insulin resistance.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a eukaryotic translation initiation factor that catalyzes the formation of puromycin-sensitive 80 S preinitiation complexes and the poly(U)-directed synthesis of polyphenylalanine at low concentrations of Mg2+. This gene should not be confused with eIF2-alpha (EIF2S1, Gene ID: 1965), the alpha subunit of the eIF2 translation initiation complex. Although both of these proteins function in binding initiator tRNA to the 40 S ribosomal subunit, the encoded protein does so in a codon-dependent manner, whereas eIF2 complex requires GTP. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor family of receptor tyrosine kinases. This protein has no ligand binding domain of its own and therefore cannot bind growth factors. However, it does bind tightly to other ligand-bound EGF receptor family members to form a heterodimer, stabilizing ligand binding and enhancing kinase-mediated activation of downstream signalling pathways, such as those involving mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase. Allelic variations at amino acid positions 654 and 655 of isoform a (positions 624 and 625 of isoform b) have been reported, with the most common allele, Ile654/Ile655, shown here. Amplification and/or overexpression of this gene has been reported in numerous cancers, including breast and ovarian tumors. Alternative splicing results in several additional transcript variants, some encoding different isoforms and others that have not been fully characterized.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family of receptor tyrosine kinases. This membrane-bound protein has a neuregulin binding domain but not an active kinase domain. It therefore can bind this ligand but not convey the signal into the cell through protein phosphorylation. However, it does form heterodimers with other EGF receptor family members which do have kinase activity. Heterodimerization leads to the activation of pathways which lead to cell proliferation or differentiation. Amplification of this gene and/or overexpression of its protein have been reported in numerous cancers, including prostate, bladder, and breast tumors. Alternate transcriptional splice variants encoding different isoforms have been characterized. One isoform lacks the intermembrane region and is secreted outside the cell. This form acts to modulate the activity of the membrane-bound form. Additional splice variants have also been reported, but they have not been thoroughly characterized.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the Tyr protein kinase family and the epidermal growth factor receptor subfamily. It encodes a single-pass type I membrane protein with multiple cysteine rich domains, a transmembrane domain, a tyrosine kinase domain, a phosphotidylinositol-3 kinase binding site and a PDZ domain binding motif. The protein binds to and is activated by neuregulins and other factors and induces a variety of cellular responses including mitogenesis and differentiation. Multiple proteolytic events allow for the release of a cytoplasmic fragment and an extracellular fragment. Mutations in this gene have been associated with cancer. Alternatively spliced variants which encode different protein isoforms have been described; however, not all variants have been fully characterized.","Variant counts

Summary
Stable cohesion between sister chromatids before anaphase and their timely separation during anaphase are critical for chromosome inheritance. In vertebrates, sister chromatid cohesion is released in 2 steps via distinct mechanisms. The first step involves phosphorylation of STAG1 (MIM 604358) or STAG2 (MIM 300826) in the cohesin complex. The second step involves cleavage of the cohesin subunit SCC1 (RAD21; MIM 606462) by ESPL1, or separase, which initiates the final separation of sister chromatids (Sun et al., 2009 [PubMed 19345191]).","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the ELAVL family of RNA-binding proteins that contain several RNA recognition motifs, and selectively bind AU-rich elements (AREs) found in the 3' untranslated regions of mRNAs. AREs signal degradation of mRNAs as a means to regulate gene expression, thus by binding AREs, the ELAVL family of proteins play a role in stabilizing ARE-containing mRNAs. This gene has been implicated in a variety of biological processes and has been linked to a number of diseases, including cancer. It is highly expressed in many cancers, and could be potentially useful in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy.","Variant counts

Summary
In humans, the ELAV like RNA binding protein gene family has four members (ELAVL1-4). ELAVL RNA binding proteins recognize AU-rich elements in the 3' UTRs of gene transcripts and thereby regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. The protein encoded by this gene binds to several 3' UTRs, including its own and also that of FOS, ID, and POU5F1. This gene encodes ELAVL2 and, like ELAVL3 and ELAVL4, is expressed specifically in neurons and primarily localizes to the cytoplasm. This protein also forms a cytosolic complex with the normally nuclear-localized ELAVL1 protein. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct protein isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
A member of the ELAVL protein family, ELAV-like 3 is a neural-specific RNA-binding protein which contains three RNP-type RNA recognition motifs. The observation that ELAVL3 is one of several Hu antigens (neuronal-specific RNA-binding proteins) recognized by the anti-Hu serum antibody present in sera from patients with paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis and sensory neuronopathy (PEM/PSN) suggests it has a role in neurogenesis. Two alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the E2F family of transcription factors. The E2F family plays a crucial role in the control of cell cycle and action of tumor suppressor proteins and is also a target of the transforming proteins of small DNA tumor viruses. The E2F proteins contain several evolutionarily conserved domains that are present in most members of the family. These domains include a DNA binding domain, a dimerization domain which determines interaction with the differentiation regulated transcription factor proteins (DP), a transactivation domain enriched in acidic amino acids, and a tumor suppressor protein association domain which is embedded within the transactivation domain. This protein is differentially phosphorylated and is expressed in a wide variety of human tissues. It has higher identity to E2F4 than to other family members. Both this protein and E2F4 interact with tumor suppressor proteins p130 and p107, but not with pRB. Alternative splicing results in multiple variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a member of the DEAD box protein family. DEAD box proteins, characterized by the conserved motif Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD), are putative RNA helicases. They are implicated in a number of cellular processes involving alteration of RNA secondary structure, such as translation initiation, nuclear and mitochondrial splicing, and ribosome and spliceosome assembly. Based on their distribution patterns, some members of this family are believed to be involved in embryogenesis, spermatogenesis, and cellular growth and division. The protein encoded by this gene is a nuclear matrix protein. Its amino acid sequence is highly similar to the amino acid sequences of the translation initiation factors eIF4AI and eIF4AII, two other members of the DEAD box protein family.","Variant counts

Summary
Many different human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) families are expressed in normal placental tissue at high levels, suggesting that HERVs are functionally important in reproduction. This gene is part of a human endogenous retrovirus provirus on chromosome 6 that has inactivating mutations in the gag and pol genes. This gene is the envelope glycoprotein gene which appears to have been selectively preserved. The gene's protein product plays a major role in placental development and trophoblast fusion. The protein has the characteristics of a typical retroviral envelope protein, including a cleavage site that separates the surface (SU) and transmembrane (TM) proteins which form a heterodimer.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene is highly similar to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SEC15 gene product, which is essential for vesicular traffic from the Golgi apparatus to the cell surface in yeast. It is one of the components of a multiprotein complex required for exocytosis. The 5' portion of this gene and two neighboring cytochrome p450 genes are included in a deletion that results in an autosomal-dominant form of nonsyndromic optic nerve aplasia (ONA). Alternative splicing and the use of alternative promoters results in multiple transcript variants. A paralogous gene encoding a similar protein is present on chromosome 2.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a member of the family of estrogen receptors and superfamily of nuclear receptor transcription factors. The gene product contains an N-terminal DNA binding domain and C-terminal ligand binding domain and is localized to the nucleus, cytoplasm, and mitochondria. Upon binding to 17beta-estradiol or related ligands, the encoded protein forms homo- or hetero-dimers that interact with specific DNA sequences to activate transcription. Some isoforms dominantly inhibit the activity of other estrogen receptor family members. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been described, but the full-length nature of some of these variants has not been fully characterized.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes an estrogen receptor and ligand-activated transcription factor. The canonical protein contains an N-terminal ligand-independent transactivation domain, a central DNA binding domain, a hinge domain, and a C-terminal ligand-dependent transactivation domain. The protein localizes to the nucleus where it may form either a homodimer or a heterodimer with estrogen receptor 2. The protein encoded by this gene regulates the transcription of many estrogen-inducible genes that play a role in growth, metabolism, sexual development, gestation, and other reproductive functions and is expressed in many non-reproductive tissues. The receptor encoded by this gene plays a key role in breast cancer, endometrial cancer, and osteoporosis. This gene is reported to have dozens of transcript variants due to the use of alternate promoters and alternative splicing, however, the full-length nature of many of these variants remain uncertain.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the synaptotagmin-like protein (Slp) family lacking a C2 domain. It contains an N-terminal synaptotagmin-like homology domain (SHD), and is a ras-related protein Rab-27B effector protein. This protein is thought to be involved in exosome secretion and intracellular vesicle trafficking. Reduced expression of this gene results in keratin filament defects. Mutations in this gene have been associated with some cases of epidermolysis bullosa, an inherited skin fragility disorder. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene was identified by its association with ectodermal dysplasia, a genetic disorder characterized by defective development of hair, teeth, and eccrine sweat glands. The protein encoded by this gene is a death domain-containing protein, and is found to interact with EDAR, a death domain receptor known to be required for the development of hair, teeth and other ectodermal derivatives. This protein and EDAR are coexpressed in epithelial cells during the formation of hair follicles and teeth. Through its interaction with EDAR, this protein acts as an adaptor, and links the receptor to downstream signaling pathways. Two alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene encoding distinct isoforms have been reported.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a component of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F complex, which recognizes the 7-methylguanosine cap structure at the 5' end of messenger RNAs. The encoded protein aids in translation initiation by recruiting ribosomes to the 5'-cap structure. Association of this protein with the 4F complex is the rate-limiting step in translation initiation. This gene acts as a proto-oncogene, and its expression and activation is associated with transformation and tumorigenesis. Several pseudogenes of this gene are found on other chromosomes. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the ephrin (EPH) family. The ephrins and EPH-related receptors comprise the largest subfamily of receptor protein-tyrosine kinases and have been implicated in mediating developmental events, especially in the nervous system and in erythropoiesis. Based on their structures and sequence relationships, ephrins are divided into the ephrin-A (EFNA) class, which are anchored to the membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage, and the ephrin-B (EFNB) class, which are transmembrane proteins. This gene encodes an EFNB class ephrin which binds to the EPHB4 and EPHA3 receptors.","Variant counts

Summary
EFNB3, a member of the ephrin gene family, is important in brain development as well as in its maintenance. Moreover, since levels of EFNB3 expression were particularly high in several forebrain subregions compared to other brain subregions, it may play a pivotal role in forebrain function. The EPH and EPH-related receptors comprise the largest subfamily of receptor protein-tyrosine kinases and have been implicated in mediating developmental events, particularly in the nervous system. EPH Receptors typically have a single kinase domain and an extracellular region containing a Cys-rich domain and 2 fibronectin type III repeats. The ephrin ligands and receptors have been named by the Eph Nomenclature Committee (1997). Based on their structures and sequence relationships, ephrins are divided into the ephrin-A (EFNA) class, which are anchored to the membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage, and the ephrin-B (EFNB) class, which are transmembrane proteins. The Eph family of receptors are similarly divided into 2 groups based on the similarity of their extracellular domain sequences and their affinities for binding ephrin-A and ephrin-B ligands.","Variant counts

Summary
Many different human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) families are expressed in normal placental tissue at high levels, suggesting that HERVs are functionally important in reproduction. This gene is part of an HERV provirus on chromosome 7 that has inactivating mutations in the gag and pol genes. This gene is the envelope glycoprotein gene which appears to have been selectively preserved. The gene's protein product is expressed in the placental syncytiotrophoblast and is involved in fusion of the cytotrophoblast cells to form the syncytial layer of the placenta. The protein has the characteristics of a typical retroviral envelope protein, including a furin cleavage site that separates the surface (SU) and transmembrane (TM) proteins which form a heterodimer. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found for this gene.","Variant counts
