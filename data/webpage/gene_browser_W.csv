Summary
The WNT gene family consists of structurally related genes which encode secreted signaling proteins. These proteins have been implicated in oncogenesis and in several developmental processes, including regulation of cell fate and patterning during embryogenesis. This gene is a member of the WNT gene family. It encodes a protein which shows 98% amino acid identity to mouse Wnt3 protein, and 84% to human WNT3A protein, another WNT gene product. The mouse studies show the requirement of Wnt3 in primary axis formation in the mouse. Studies of the gene expression suggest that this gene may play a key role in some cases of human breast, rectal, lung, and gastric cancer through activation of the WNT-beta-catenin-TCF signaling pathway. This gene is clustered with WNT15, another family member, in the chromosome 17q21 region.","Variant counts

Summary
The WNT gene family consists of structurally related genes which encode secreted signaling proteins. These proteins have been implicated in oncogenesis and in several developmental processes, including regulation of cell fate and patterning during embryogenesis. This gene is a member of the WNT gene family. It is very conserved in evolution, and the protein encoded by this gene is known to be 98% identical to the mouse Wnt1 protein at the amino acid level. The studies in mouse indicate that the Wnt1 protein functions in the induction of the mesencephalon and cerebellum. This gene was originally considered as a candidate gene for Joubert syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder with cerebellar hypoplasia as a leading feature. However, further studies suggested that the gene mutations might not have a significant role in Joubert syndrome. This gene is clustered with another family member, WNT10B, in the chromosome 12q13 region.","Variant counts

Summary
The WNT gene family consists of structurally related genes which encode secreted signaling proteins. These proteins have been implicated in oncogenesis and in several developmental processes, including regulation of cell fate and patterning during embryogenesis. This gene is a member of the WNT gene family, and is the first signaling molecule shown to influence the sex-determination cascade. It encodes a protein which shows 98% amino acid identity to the Wnt4 protein of mouse and rat. This gene and a nuclear receptor known to antagonize the testis-determining factor play a concerted role in both the control of female development and the prevention of testes formation. This gene and another two family members, WNT2 and WNT7B, may be associated with abnormal proliferation in breast tissue. Mutations in this gene can result in Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome and in SERKAL syndrome.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the WD repeat protein family. WD repeats are minimally conserved regions of approximately 40 amino acids typically bracketed by gly-his and trp-asp (GH-WD) that may facilitate formation of heterotrimeric or multiprotein complexes. Members of this family are involved in a variety of cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, signal transduction, apoptosis, and gene regulation. The encoded protein forms the beta subunit of rabconnectin-3 and binds directly with Rab3A GDP/GTP exchange protein and indirectly with Rab3A GDP/GTP activating protein; these proteins are regulators of Rab3 small G protein family members involved in control of the calcium-dependant exocytosis of neurotransmitters. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR) protein family. This gene spans the FRA16D common chromosomal fragile site and appears to function as a tumor suppressor gene. Expression of the encoded protein is able to induce apoptosis, while defects in this gene are associated with multiple types of cancer. Disruption of this gene is also associated with autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia 12. Disruption of a similar gene in mouse results in impaired steroidogenesis, additionally suggesting a metabolic function for the protein. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the WD (tryptophan-aspartic acid) repeat family, which is a large family of structurally-related proteins known to participate in a wide range of cellular processes. Each WD repeat typically contains about 40 amino acids that are usually bracketed by glycine-histidine and tryptophan-aspartic acid (WD) dipeptides. This protein contains six WD repeats, three transmembrane domains, and a clathrin heavy-chain repeat. Mutations in this gene have been described in individuals with a wide range of disorders affecting function of the cilium. These disorders are known as ciliopathies, and include Jeune syndrome, Sensenbrenner syndromes, Senior-Loken syndrome, combined or isolated nephronophthisis (NPHP), and retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
WW domain-containing proteins are found in all eukaryotes and play an important role in the regulation of a wide variety of cellular functions such as protein degradation, transcription, and RNA splicing. This gene encodes a protein which contains 4 tandem WW domains and a HECT (homologous to the E6-associated protein carboxyl terminus) domain. The encoded protein belongs to a family of NEDD4-like proteins, which are E3 ubiquitin-ligase molecules and regulate key trafficking decisions, including targeting of proteins to proteosomes or lysosomes. Alternative splicing of this gene generates at least 6 transcript variants; however, the full length nature of these transcripts has not been defined.","Variant counts

Summary
The function and protein-coding potential of this gene is unknown. The exon combination is based on AB058778.1 for which two possible open reading frames can be predicted (with start codons at nucleotide 26 or 2614). The position of the first ORF stop codon is consistent with a prediction of nonsense-mediated decay. Given the observation of the first ORF and its length, a predicted translation of the second ORF is inconsistent with the translation leaky scanning theory. Therefore, this gene is represented as a non-protein-coding transcript.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is thought to contain multiple WD40 repeats. WD40 repeats are motifs that contain 40-60 amino acids, and usually end with Trp-Asp (WD). This protein is found in the cytoplasm during interphase, but accumulates at the spindle poles and astral microtubules during mitosis. Reduced expression of this gene results in abnormalities in the size and morphology of the nucleus. Mutations in this gene have been associated with Galloway-Mowat syndrome PMID: 25466283), which is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that affects both the central nervous system and kidneys. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate-binding protein that functions as a master conductor for aggregate clearance by autophagy. This protein shuttles from the nuclear membrane to colocalize with aggregated proteins, where it complexes with other autophagic components to achieve macroautophagy-mediated clearance of these aggregated proteins. However, it is not necessary for starvation-induced macroautophagy.","Variant counts

Because of their central role in linking amino acids with nucleotide triplets contained in tRNAs, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are thought to be among the first proteins that appeared in evolution. Two forms of tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase exist, a cytoplasmic form, named WARS, and a mitochondrial form, named WARS2. This gene encodes the mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase. Two alternative transcripts encoding different isoforms have been described.","Variant counts

Summary
The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) family of proteins share similar domain structure, and are involved in transduction of signals from receptors on the cell surface to the actin cytoskeleton. The presence of a number of different motifs suggests that they are regulated by a number of different stimuli, and interact with multiple proteins. Recent studies have demonstrated that these proteins, directly or indirectly, associate with the small GTPase, Cdc42, known to regulate formation of actin filaments, and the cytoskeletal organizing complex, Arp2/3. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is a rare, inherited, X-linked, recessive disease characterized by immune dysregulation and microthrombocytopenia, and is caused by mutations in the WAS gene. The WAS gene product is a cytoplasmic protein, expressed exclusively in hematopoietic cells, which show signalling and cytoskeletal abnormalities in WAS patients. A transcript variant arising as a result of alternative promoter usage, and containing a different 5' UTR sequence, has been described, however, its full-length nature is not known.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a protein that plays a role in actin nucleation, Golgi membrane association and microtubule binding. The encoded protein is a nucleation-promoting factor that regulates the Actin-related protein 2/3 complex. The activated complex initiates growth of new actin filaments by binding to existing actin filaments. The encoded protein also functions in regulation of transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex and in maintenance of the Golgi complex near the centrosome. Four pseudogenes of this gene are present on the same arm of chromosome 15 as this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Werner's syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by accelerated aging that is caused by defects in the Werner syndrome ATP-dependent helicase gene (WRN). The protein encoded by this gene interacts with the exonuclease-containing N-terminal portion of the Werner protein. This protein has a ubiquitin-binding zinc-finger domain in the N-terminus, an ATPase domain, and two leucine zipper motifs in the C-terminus. It has sequence similarity to replication factor C family proteins and is conserved from E. coli to human. This protein likely accumulates at sites of DNA damage by interacting with polyubiquinated proteins and also binds to DNA polymerase delta and increases the initiation frequency of DNA polymerase delta-mediated DNA synthesis. This protein also interacts with nucleoporins at nuclear pore complexes. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been isolated for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes an essential component of the telomerase holoenzyme complex, a ribonucleoprotein complex required for telomere synthesis. This protein is enriched in Cajal bodies, nuclear sites of RNP processing that are important for telomerase function. It interacts with dyskerin, TERT and TERC, other components of active telomerase, and with small Cajal body RNAs (scaRNAs), which are involved in modifying splicing RNAs. This mRNA also functions as a p53 antisense transcript, that regulates endogenous p53 mRNA levels and further induction of p53 protein by targeting the 5' untranslated region of p53 mRNA. Alternatively spliced transcript variants which differ only in the 5' UTR have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The WNT gene family consists of structurally related genes which encode secreted signaling proteins. These proteins have been implicated in oncogenesis and in several developmental processes, including regulation of cell fate and patterning during embryogenesis. This gene is a member of the WNT gene family. It encodes a protein which shows 95%, 86% and 71% amino acid identity to the mouse, zebrafish and Xenopus Wnt8B proteins, respectively. The expression patterns of the human and mouse genes appear identical and are restricted to the developing brain. The chromosomal location of this gene to 10q24 suggests it as a candidate gene for partial epilepsy.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene, a member of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP)-family, plays a critical role downstream of Rac, a Rho-family small GTPase, in regulating the actin cytoskeleton required for membrane ruffling. It has been shown to associate with an actin nucleation core Arp2/3 complex while enhancing actin polymerization in vitro. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is a disease of the immune system, likely due to defects in regulation of actin cytoskeleton. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein family. The gene product is a protein that forms a multiprotein complex that links receptor kinases and actin. Binding to actin occurs through a C-terminal verprolin homology domain in all family members. The multiprotein complex serves to tranduce signals that involve changes in cell shape, motility or function. The published map location (PMID:10381382) has been changed based on recent genomic sequence comparisons, which indicate that the expressed gene is located on chromosome 1, and a pseudogene may be located on chromosome X. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a transcription factor that contains four zinc-finger motifs at the C-terminus and a proline/glutamine-rich DNA-binding domain at the N-terminus. It has an essential role in the normal development of the urogenital system, and it is mutated in a small subset of patients with Wilms tumor. This gene exhibits complex tissue-specific and polymorphic imprinting pattern, with biallelic, and monoallelic expression from the maternal and paternal alleles in different tissues. Multiple transcript variants have been described. In several variants, there is evidence for the use of a non-AUG (CUG) translation initiation codon upstream of, and in-frame with the first AUG. Authors of PMID:7926762 also provide evidence that WT1 mRNA undergoes RNA editing in human and rat, and that this process is tissue-restricted and developmentally regulated.","Variant counts

Summary
The Wilms tumor suppressor gene WT1 appears to play a role in both transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of certain cellular genes. This gene encodes a WT1-associating protein, which is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein. Like WT1 protein, this protein is localized throughout the nucleoplasm as well as in speckles and partially colocalizes with splicing factors. Alternative splicing of this gene results in several transcript variants encoding three different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a 134 kDa protein named strumpellin that is predicted to have multiple transmembrane domains and a spectrin-repeat-containing domain. This ubiquitously expressed gene has its highest expression in skeletal muscle. The protein is named for Strumpell disease; a form of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). Spastic paraplegias are a diverse group of disorders in which the autosomal dominant forms are characterized by progressive, lower extremity spasticity caused by axonal degeneration in the terminal portions of the longest descending and ascending corticospinal tracts. More than 30 loci (SPG1-33) have been implicated in hereditary spastic paraplegia diseases.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the WD repeat protein family. WD repeats are minimally conserved regions of approximately 40 amino acids typically bracketed by gly-his and trp-asp (GH-WD), which may facilitate formation of heterotrimeric or multiprotein complexes. Members of this family are involved in a variety of cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, signal transduction, apoptosis, and gene regulation. Studies of the related mouse protein suggest that the encoded protein may play a role in the process of ossification.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a nuclear protein, which colocalizes with mRNA splicing factors and intermediate filament-containing perinuclear networks. This protein has 95% amino acid sequence identity to the mouse Wbp11 protein. It contains two proline-rich regions that bind to the WW domain of Npw38, a nuclear protein, and thus this protein is also called Npw38-binding protein NpwBP. The Npw38-NpwBP complex may function as a component of an mRNA factory in the nucleus.","Variant counts

Summary
The WNT gene family consists of structurally related genes that encode secreted signaling proteins. These proteins have been implicated in oncogenesis and in several developmental processes, including regulation of cell fate and patterning during embryogenesis. This gene is a member of the WNT gene family. Study of its expression in the teratocarcinoma cell line NT2 suggests that it may be implicated in the early process of neuronal differentiation of NT2 cells induced by retinoic acid. This gene is clustered with WNT3, another family member, in the chromosome 17q21 region. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The WNT gene family consists of structurally related genes which encode secreted signaling proteins. These proteins have been implicated in oncogenesis and in several developmental processes, including regulation of cell fate and patterning during embryogenesis. This gene is a member of the WNT gene family. It contains two transcript variants diverging at the 5' termini. These two variants are proposed to be the products of separate promoters and not to be splice variants from a single promoter. They are differentially expressed in normal tissues, one of which (variant 2) is expressed at significant levels only in the pancreas, whereas another one (variant 1) is expressed more ubiquitously with highest levels in adult kidney, placenta, brain, heart, and spleen.","Variant counts
