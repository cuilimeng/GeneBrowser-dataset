Summary
This gene encodes a Jumonji- and AT-rich interaction domain (ARID)-domain-containing protein. The encoded protein is a DNA-binding protein that functions as a transcriptional repressor. This protein interacts with the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) which plays an essential role in regulating gene expression during embryonic development. This protein facilitates the recruitment of the PRC2 complex to target genes. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Mutations in this gene are associated with chronic myeloid malignancies.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a central role in cytokine and growth factor signalling. The primary isoform of this protein has an N-terminal FERM domain that is required for erythropoietin receptor association, an SH2 domain that binds STAT transcription factors, a pseudokinase domain and a C-terminal tyrosine kinase domain. Cytokine binding induces autophosphorylation and activation of this kinase. This kinase then recruits and phosphorylates signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins. Growth factors like TGF-beta 1 also induce phosphorylation and activation of this kinase and translocation of downstream STAT proteins to the nucleus where they influence gene transcription. Mutations in this gene are associated with numerous inflammatory diseases and malignancies. This gene is a downstream target of the pleiotropic cytokine IL6 that is produced by B cells, T cells, dendritic cells and macrophages to produce an immune response or inflammation. Disregulation of the IL6/JAK2/STAT3 signalling pathways produces increased cellular proliferation and myeloproliferative neoplasms of hematopoietic stem cells. A nonsynonymous mutation in the pseudokinase domain of this gene disrupts the domains inhibitory effect and results in constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation activity and hypersensitivity to cytokine signalling. This gene and the IL6/JAK2/STAT3 signalling pathway is a therapeutic target for the treatment of excessive inflammatory responses to viral infections. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a membrane protein that is a member of a class of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTK) characterized by the presence of a second phosphotransferase-related domain immediately N-terminal to the PTK domain. The encoded kinase phosphorylates STAT proteins (signal transducers and activators of transcription) and plays a key role in interferon-alpha/beta, interferon-gamma, and cytokine signal transduction. This gene plays a crucial role in effecting the expression of genes that mediate inflammation, epithelial remodeling, and metastatic cancer progression. This gene is a key component of the interleukin-6 (IL-6)/JAK1/STAT3 immune and inflammation response and is a therapeutic target for alleviating cytokine storms. The kinase activity of this gene is directly inhibited by the suppressor of cytokine signalling 1 (SOCS1) protein. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a nuclear protein with a JmjC domain. JmjC domain-containing proteins are predicted to function as protein hydroxylases or histone demethylases. This protein was first identified as a putative phosphatidylserine receptor involved in phagocytosis of apoptotic cells; however, subsequent studies have indicated that it does not directly function in the clearance of apoptotic cells, and questioned whether it is a true phosphatidylserine receptor. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a major cytoplasmic protein which is the only known constituent common to submembranous plaques of both desmosomes and intermediate junctions. This protein forms distinct complexes with cadherins and desmosomal cadherins and is a member of the catenin family since it contains a distinct repeating amino acid motif called the armadillo repeat. Mutation in this gene has been associated with Naxos disease. Alternative splicing occurs in this gene; however, not all transcripts have been fully described.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene interacts with thyroid hormone receptors and contains a jumonji domain. It is a candidate histone demethylase and is thought to be a coactivator for key transcription factors. It plays a role in the DNA-damage response pathway by demethylating the mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1 (MDC1) protein, and is required for the survival of acute myeloid leukemia. Mutations in this gene are associated with Rett syndrome and intellectual disability. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

This gene belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily, and the junctional adhesion molecule (JAM) family. The protein encoded by this gene is a type I membrane protein that is localized at the tight junctions of both epithelial and endothelial cells. It acts as an adhesive ligand for interacting with a variety of immune cell types, and may play a role in lymphocyte homing to secondary lymphoid organs. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Tight junctions represent one mode of cell-to-cell adhesion in epithelial or endothelial cell sheets, forming continuous seals around cells and serving as a physical barrier to prevent solutes and water from passing freely through the paracellular space. The protein encoded by this immunoglobulin superfamily gene member is localized in the tight junctions between high endothelial cells. Unlike other proteins in this family, the this protein is unable to adhere to leukocyte cell lines and only forms weak homotypic interactions. The encoded protein is a member of the junctional adhesion molecule protein family and acts as a receptor for another member of this family. A mutation in an intron of this gene is associated with hemorrhagic destruction of the brain, subependymal calcification, and congenital cataracts. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a member of a family of large proteins containing PHD (plant homeo domain)-type zinc fingers. The encoded protein may be associated in a nuclear complex that functions in histone H4 acetylation. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding the same protein.","Variant counts
The variants found in rare patients tested by 3billion are classified and counted according to ACMG guidelines. The variants with over 5% variant frequency in population genome databases ( gnomAD, dbSNP, etc) are excluded.

Summary
This gene encodes a conserved protein that is similar to DNA-binding proteins, such as major centromere autoantigen B (CENPB). Inactivation of the related gene in mice resulted in epileptic seizures. Childhood Absence Epilepsy (CAE) has been mapped to the same chromosomal location (8q24.3) as this gene. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts
