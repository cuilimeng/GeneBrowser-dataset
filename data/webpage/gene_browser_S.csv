Summary
SLC36A4 belongs to the SLC36 family of amino acid transporters based on sequence similarity with other family members (e.g., SLC36A1; MIM 606561). SLC36 proteins contain about 500 amino acids and have 9 to 11 transmembrane domains. Unlike other SLC36 family members, which are proton-coupled amino acid transporters, SLC36A4 is a high-affinity/low-capacity non-proton-coupled amino acid transporter (Pillai and Meredith, 2011 [PubMed 21097500]).","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene binds to the hydrophobic C-terminal amino acids of CD4 which are involved in repression of T cell activation. The interaction with CD4 is mediated by the noncatalytic alpha/beta hydrolase fold domain of this protein. It is thus proposed that this gene product modulates the stimulatory activity of CD4. Mutations in this gene are associated with autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia 21 (SPG21), also known as mast syndrome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

The vesicular monoamine transporter acts to accumulate cytosolic monoamines into vesicles, using the proton gradient maintained across the vesicular membrane. Its proper function is essential to the correct activity of the monoaminergic systems that have been implicated in several human neuropsychiatric disorders. The transporter is a site of action of important drugs, including reserpine and tetrabenazine (Peter et al., 1993 [PubMed 7905859]). See also SLC18A2 (MIM 193001).","Variant counts

Summary
Phosphate homeostasis is maintained by regulating intake, intestinal absorption, bone deposition and resorption, and renal excretion of phosphate. The central molecule in the control of phosphate excretion from the kidney is the sodium/phosphate cotransporter NPT1 (SLC17A1; MIM 182308), which is located in the renal proximal tubule. NPT1 uses the transmembrane electrochemical potential gradient of sodium to transport phosphate across the cell membrane. SLC17A4 is a similar sodium/phosphate cotransporter in the intestinal mucosa that plays an important role in the absorption of phosphate from the intestine (summary by Shibui et al., 1999 [PubMed 10319585]).","Variant counts

Summary
Synaptotagmins, such as SYT5, are a family of type III membrane proteins characterized by cytoplasmic repeats related to protein kinase C (see MIM 176960) regulatory (C2) domains, which are thought to bind calcium. Synaptotagmins may act both as negative regulators of vesicle fusion, allowing fusion in the presence of calcium, and as calcium receptors or sensor molecules (summary by Hudson and Birnbaum, 1995 [PubMed 7597049]).","Variant counts

Summary
Arg and c-Abl represent the mammalian members of the Abelson family of non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinases. They interact with the Arg/Abl binding proteins via the SH3 domains present in the carboxy end of the latter group of proteins. This gene encodes the sorbin and SH3 domain containing 2 protein. It has three C-terminal SH3 domains and an N-terminal sorbin homology (SoHo) domain that interacts with lipid raft proteins. The subcellular localization of this protein in epithelial and cardiac muscle cells suggests that it functions as an adapter protein to assemble signaling complexes in stress fibers, and that it is a potential link between Abl family kinases and the actin cytoskeleton. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a DNA-binding protein which has high specificity for scaffold or matrix attachment region DNA elements (S/MAR DNA). This protein is thought to be involved in attaching the base of chromatin loops to the nuclear matrix but there is conflicting evidence as to whether this protein is a component of chromatin or a nuclear matrix protein. Scaffold attachment factors are a specific subset of nuclear matrix proteins (NMP) that specifically bind to S/MAR. The encoded protein is thought to serve as a molecular base to assemble a 'transcriptosome complex' in the vicinity of actively transcribed genes. It is involved in the regulation of heat shock protein 27 transcription, can act as an estrogen receptor co-repressor and is a candidate for breast tumorigenesis. This gene is arranged head-to-head with a similar gene whose product has the same functions. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the Shank gene family. Shank proteins are multidomain scaffold proteins of the postsynaptic density that connect neurotransmitter receptors, ion channels, and other membrane proteins to the actin cytoskeleton and G-protein-coupled signaling pathways. Shank proteins also play a role in synapse formation and dendritic spine maturation. Mutations in this gene are a cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which is characterized by impairments in social interaction and communication, and restricted behavioral patterns and interests. Mutations in this gene also cause schizophrenia type 15, and are a major causative factor in the neurological symptoms of 22q13.3 deletion syndrome, which is also known as Phelan-McDermid syndrome. Additional isoforms have been described for this gene but they have not yet been experimentally verified.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that is a member of the Shank family of synaptic proteins that may function as molecular scaffolds in the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses. Shank proteins contain multiple domains for protein-protein interaction, including ankyrin repeats, and an SH3 domain. This particular family member contains a PDZ domain, a consensus sequence for cortactin SH3 domain-binding peptides and a sterile alpha motif. The alternative splicing demonstrated in Shank genes has been suggested as a mechanism for regulating the molecular structure of Shank and the spectrum of Shank-interacting proteins in the postsynaptic densities of the adult and developing brain. Alterations in the encoded protein may be associated with susceptibility to autism spectrum disorder. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the serpin family of proteinase inhibitors. Members of this family maintain homeostasis by neutralizing overexpressed proteinase activity through their function as suicide substrates. This protein inhibits the neutrophil-derived proteinases neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G, and proteinase-3 and thus protects tissues from damage at inflammatory sites. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the serpin family of serine protease inhibitors. The encoded protein is highly expressed in many tumor cells and can inactivate granzyme M, an enzyme that kills tumor cells. This protein, along with serpin B3, can be processed into smaller fragments that aggregate to form an autoantigen in psoriasis, probably by causing chronic inflammation.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the serpin (serine proteinase inhibitor) superfamily, and ovalbumin(ov)-serpin subfamily. It was originally discovered as a placental thrombin inhibitor. The mouse homolog was found to be expressed in the hair cells of the inner ear. Mutations in this gene are associated with nonsyndromic progressive hearing loss, suggesting that this serpin plays an important role in the inner ear in the protection against leakage of lysosomal content during stress, and that loss of this protection results in cell death and sensorineural hearing loss. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a p53-inducible protein that is able to induce lysosome-like organelles within mitochondria that eliminate oxidized mitochondrial proteins, thereby contributing to mitochondrial quality control. Dysregulation of mitochondrial quality control is associated with cancer and degenerative diseases. The encoded protein mediates accumulation of the lysosome-like mitochondrial organelles through interaction with B cell lymphoma 2 interacting protein 3 and B cell lymphoma 2 interacting protein 3 like at the outer mitochondrial membrane, which allows translocation of lysosomal proteins to the mitochondrial matrix from the cytosol. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a protein that belongs to a family of light subunits of amino acid transporters. This protein plays a role in the high-affinity and sodium-independent transport of cystine and neutral and dibasic amino acids, and appears to function in the reabsorption of cystine in the kidney tubule. Mutations in this gene cause non-type I cystinuria, a disease that leads to cystine stones in the urinary system due to impaired transport of cystine and dibasic amino acids. Alternate transcript variants, which encode the same protein, have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Like other members of the family, the protein encoded by this gene contains RapGAP and PDZ domains. In addition, this protein contains a C-terminal leucine zipper domain. This gene is proposed to function in epithelial cell morphogenesis and establishment or maintenance of polarity. Consistently, expression of the protein in cell culture showed localization to cell-cell borders in apical regions, and downregulation of the gene in 3D Caco2 cell culture resulted in abnormal cell polarity and morphogenesis. Allelic variants of this gene have been associated with congenital cataracts in humans.","Variant counts

Summary
Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPases are transmembrane proteins that catalyze the ATP-dependent transport of Ca(2+) from the cytosol into the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum in muscle cells. This gene encodes a small proteolipid that regulates several sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPases. The transmembrane protein interacts with Ca(2+)-ATPases and reduces the accumulation of Ca(2+) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum without affecting the rate of ATP hydrolysis.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the ADP/ATP carrier family of proteins that exchange cytosolic ADP for matrix ATP in the mitochondria. Cells over-expressing this gene have been shown to display an anti-apoptotic phenotype. This protein is also thought to play a role in spermatogenesis, where it is believed to associate with a part of the flagellar cytoskeleton and with glycolytic enzymes. Male mice with mutations in the mouse ortholog of this gene are sterile and spermatocytes display an early meiotic arrest phenotype. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the SLC25 transporter or mitochondrial carrier family of proteins. Members of this family are encoded by the nuclear genome while their protein products are usually embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane and exhibit wide-ranging substrate specificity. Although the encoded protein is currently considered an orphan transporter, this protein is related to other carriers known to transport amino acids. This protein may play a role in iron homeostasis.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a subunit of a heterodimer that, along with SUPT16H, forms chromatin transcriptional elongation factor FACT. FACT interacts specifically with histones H2A/H2B to effect nucleosome disassembly and transcription elongation. FACT and cisplatin-damaged DNA may be crucial to the anticancer mechanism of cisplatin. This encoded protein contains a high mobility group box which most likely constitutes the structure recognition element for cisplatin-modified DNA. This protein also functions as a co-activator of the transcriptional activator p63. An alternatively spliced transcript variant of this gene has been described, but its full-length nature is not known.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene is a component of the SMAD pathway, which regulates cell growth and differentiation through transforming growth factor-beta (TGFB). In the absence of ligand, the encoded protein binds to the promoter region of TGFB-responsive genes and recruits a nuclear repressor complex. TGFB signaling causes SMAD3 to enter the nucleus and degrade this protein, allowing these genes to be activated. Four transcript variants encoding three different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the AAA (ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities) protein family. Members of this protein family share an ATPase domain and have roles in diverse cellular processes including membrane trafficking, intracellular motility, organelle biogenesis, protein folding, and proteolysis. The use of alternative translational initiation sites in this gene results in a single transcript variant that can produce isoforms that differ in the length of their N-terminus and which thereby differ in the efficiency of their export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. In addition, alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants that encode isoforms that differ in other protein regions as well. One isoform of this gene has been shown to be a microtubule-severing enzyme that regulates microtubule abundance, mobility, and plus-end distribution. Mutations in this gene cause the most frequent form of autosomal dominant spastic paraplegia 4.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that plays a major role in the bidirectional stimulation of T and B cells. This protein contains an SH2 domain and a short tail. It associates with the signaling lymphocyte-activation molecule, thereby acting as an inhibitor of this transmembrane protein by blocking the recruitment of the SH2-domain-containing signal-transduction molecule SHP-2 to its docking site. This protein can also bind to other related surface molecules that are expressed on activated T, B and NK cells, thereby modifying signal transduction pathways in these cells. Mutations in this gene cause lymphoproliferative syndrome X-linked type 1 or Duncan disease, a rare immunodeficiency characterized by extreme susceptibility to infection with Epstein-Barr virus, with symptoms including severe mononucleosis and malignant lymphoma. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Sclerostin is a secreted glycoprotein with a C-terminal cysteine knot-like (CTCK) domain and sequence similarity to the DAN (differential screening-selected gene aberrative in neuroblastoma) family of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonists. Loss-of-function mutations in this gene are associated with an autosomal-recessive disorder, sclerosteosis, which causes progressive bone overgrowth. A deletion downstream of this gene, which causes reduced sclerostin expression, is associated with a milder form of the disorder called van Buchem disease.","Variant counts

Summary
STIP1 is an adaptor protein that coordinates the functions of HSP70 (see HSPA1A; MIM 140550) and HSP90 (see HSP90AA1; MIM 140571) in protein folding. It is thought to assist in the transfer of proteins from HSP70 to HSP90 by binding both HSP90 and substrate-bound HSP70. STIP1 also stimulates the ATPase activity of HSP70 and inhibits the ATPase activity of HSP90, suggesting that it regulates both the conformations and ATPase cycles of these chaperones (Song and Masison, 2005 [PubMed 16100115]).","Variant counts

Summary
Voltage-gated sodium channels are heteromeric proteins that function in the generation and propagation of action potentials in muscle and neuronal cells. They are composed of one alpha and two beta subunits, where the alpha subunit provides channel activity and the beta-1 subunit modulates the kinetics of channel inactivation. This gene encodes a sodium channel beta-1 subunit. Mutations in this gene result in generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus, Brugada syndrome 5, and defects in cardiac conduction. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Voltage-dependent sodium channels are heteromeric complexes that regulate sodium exchange between intracellular and extracellular spaces and are essential for the generation and propagation of action potentials in muscle cells and neurons. Each sodium channel is composed of a large pore-forming, glycosylated alpha subunit and two smaller beta subunits. This gene encodes a sodium channel alpha subunit, which has four homologous domains, each of which contains six transmembrane regions. Allelic variants of this gene are associated with generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures and epileptic encephalopathy. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. The RefSeq Project has decided to create four representative RefSeq records. Three of the transcript variants are supported by experimental evidence and the fourth contains alternate 5' untranslated exons, the exact combination of which have not been experimentally confirmed for the full-length transcript.","Variant counts

Summary
Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD; EC 1.14.99.5) is an integral membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum that catalyzes the formation of monounsaturated fatty acids from saturated fatty acids. SCD may be a key regulator of energy metabolism with a role in obesity and dislipidemia. Four SCD isoforms, Scd1 through Scd4, have been identified in mouse. In contrast, only 2 SCD isoforms, SCD1 (MIM 604031) and SCD5, have been identified in human. SCD1 shares about 85% amino acid identity with all 4 mouse SCD isoforms, as well as with rat Scd1 and Scd2. In contrast, SCD5 shares limited homology with the rodent SCDs and appears to be unique to primates (Wang et al., 2005 [PubMed 15907797]).","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a sucrase-isomaltase enzyme that is expressed in the intestinal brush border. The encoded protein is synthesized as a precursor protein that is cleaved by pancreatic proteases into two enzymatic subunits sucrase and isomaltase. These two subunits heterodimerize to form the sucrose-isomaltase complex. This complex is essential for the digestion of dietary carbohydrates including starch, sucrose and isomaltose. Mutations in this gene are the cause of congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a retinoic acid-responsive protein. A homologous protein in mouse has been shown to be involved in the regulation of meiotic initiation in both spermatogenesis and oogenesis, though feature differences between the mouse and human proteins suggest that these homologs are not entirely functionally equivalent. It is thought that this gene may play a role in spermatogenesis in humans.","Variant counts

Summary
Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (SIGLECs) are a family of cell surface proteins belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. They mediate protein-carbohydrate interactions by selectively binding to different sialic acid moieties present on glycolipids and glycoproteins. This gene encodes a member of the SIGLEC3-like subfamily of SIGLECs. Members of this subfamily are characterized by an extracellular V-set immunoglobulin-like domain followed by two C2-set immunoglobulin-like domains, and the cytoplasmic tyrosine-based motifs ITIM and SLAM-like. The encoded protein, upon tyrosine phosphorylation, has been shown to recruit the Src homology 2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatases SHP1 and SHP2. It has been suggested that the protein is involved in the negative regulation of macrophage signaling by functioning as an inhibitory receptor. This gene is located in a cluster with other SIGLEC3-like genes on 19q13.4. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a member of the signal peptide, complement subcomponents C1r/C1s, Uegf, bone morphogenetic protein-1 and epidermal growth factor-like domain containing protein family. Overexpression of this gene in human embryonic kidney cells results in secretion of a glycosylated form of the protein that forms oligomers and tethers to the cell surface. This gene is upregulated in lung cancer tumor tissue compared to healthy tissue and is associated with loss of the epithelial marker E-cadherin and with increased expression of vimentin, a mesenchymal marker. In addition, the protein encoded by this gene is a transforming growth factor beta receptor ligand, and when secreted by cancer cells, it can be cleaved in vitro to release the N-terminal epidermal growth factor-like repeat domain and the C-terminal complement subcomponents C1r/C1s domain. Both the full length protein and C-terminal fragment can bind to the transforming growth factor beta type II receptor to promote the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and tumor angiogenesis. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is part of the anion exchanger (AE) family and is expressed in the erythrocyte plasma membrane, where it functions as a chloride/bicarbonate exchanger involved in carbon dioxide transport from tissues to lungs. The protein comprises two domains that are structurally and functionally distinct. The N-terminal 40kDa domain is located in the cytoplasm and acts as an attachment site for the red cell skeleton by binding ankyrin. The glycosylated C-terminal membrane-associated domain contains 12-14 membrane spanning segments and carries out the stilbene disulphonate-sensitive exchange transport of anions. The cytoplasmic tail at the extreme C-terminus of the membrane domain binds carbonic anhydrase II. The encoded protein associates with the red cell membrane protein glycophorin A and this association promotes the correct folding and translocation of the exchanger. This protein is predominantly dimeric but forms tetramers in the presence of ankyrin. Many mutations in this gene are known in man, and these mutations can lead to two types of disease: destabilization of red cell membrane leading to hereditary spherocytosis, and defective kidney acid secretion leading to distal renal tubular acidosis. Other mutations that do not give rise to disease result in novel blood group antigens, which form the Diego blood group system. Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (SAO, Melanesian ovalocytosis) results from the heterozygous presence of a deletion in the encoded protein and is common in areas where Plasmodium falciparum malaria is endemic. One null mutation in this gene is known, resulting in very severe anemia and nephrocalcinosis.","Variant counts

Summary
Temporally regulated transcription and translation of several testis-specific genes is required to initiate the series of molecular and morphological changes in the male germ cell lineage necessary for the formation of mature spermatozoa. This gene is a member of the SPANX family of cancer/testis-associated genes, which are located in a cluster on chromosome X. The SPANX genes encode differentially expressed testis-specific proteins that localize to various subcellular compartments. This particular gene maps to chromosome X in a head-to-head orientation with SPANX family member A2, which appears to be a duplication of the A1 locus. The protein encoded by this gene targets to the nucleus where it associates with nuclear vacuoles and the redundant nuclear envelope. Based on its association with these poorly characterized regions of the sperm nucleus, this protein provides a biochemical marker to study unique structures in spermatazoa while attempting to further define its role in spermatogenesis.","Variant counts

Summary
Pre-mRNA splicing is catalyzed by the spliceosome, a complex of specialized RNA and protein subunits that removes introns from a transcribed pre-mRNA segment. The spliceosome consists of small nuclear RNA proteins (snRNPs) U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6, together with approximately 80 conserved proteins. U5 snRNP contains nine specific proteins. This gene encodes one of the U5 snRNP-specific proteins. This protein belongs to the DEXH-box family of putative RNA helicases. It is a core component of U4/U6-U5 snRNPs and appears to catalyze an ATP-dependent unwinding of U4/U6 RNA duplices. Mutations in this gene cause autosomal-dominant retinitis pigmentosa. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found, but the full-length nature of these variants has not been determined.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a type 1 transmembrane protein that mediates Ca2+ influx after depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores by gating of store-operated Ca2+ influx channels (SOCs). It is one of several genes located in the imprinted gene domain of 11p15.5, an important tumor-suppressor gene region. Alterations in this region have been associated with the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Wilms tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, adrenocrotical carcinoma, and lung, ovarian, and breast cancer. This gene may play a role in malignancies and disease that involve this region, as well as early hematopoiesis, by mediating attachment to stromal cells. Mutations in this gene are associated with fatal classic Kaposi sarcoma, immunodeficiency due to defects in store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) in fibroblasts, ectodermal dysplasia and tubular aggregate myopathy. This gene is oriented in a head-to-tail configuration with the ribonucleotide reductase 1 gene (RRM1), with the 3' end of this gene situated 1.6 kb from the 5' end of the RRM1 gene. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the stromal interaction molecule (STIM) family and likely arose, along with related family member STIM1, from a common ancestral gene. The encoded protein functions to regulate calcium concentrations in the cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum, and is involved in the activation of plasma membrane Orai Ca(2+) entry channels. This gene initiates translation from a non-AUG (UUG) start site. A signal peptide is cleaved from the resulting protein. Multiple transcript variants result from alternative splicing.","Variant counts

It is thought to play a role in the regulation of axonal growth and the development of synaptic plasticity. Mutations in this gene result in familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies (FENIB), which is a dominantly inherited form of familial encephalopathy and epilepsy characterized by the accumulation of mutant neuroserpin polymers.

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the signal-regulatory-protein (SIRP) family, and also belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily. SIRP family members are receptor-type transmembrane glycoproteins known to be involved in the negative regulation of receptor tyrosine kinase-coupled signaling processes. This protein can be phosphorylated by tyrosine kinases. The phospho-tyrosine residues of this PTP have been shown to recruit SH2 domain containing tyrosine phosphatases (PTP), and serve as substrates of PTPs. This protein was found to participate in signal transduction mediated by various growth factor receptors. CD47 has been demonstrated to be a ligand for this receptor protein. This gene and its product share very high similarity with several other members of the SIRP family. These related genes are located in close proximity to each other on chromosome 20p13. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been determined for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The hormone somatostatin has active 14 aa and 28 aa forms that are produced by alternate cleavage of the single preproprotein encoded by this gene. Somatostatin is expressed throughout the body and inhibits the release of numerous secondary hormones by binding to high-affinity G-protein-coupled somatostatin receptors. This hormone is an important regulator of the endocrine system through its interactions with pituitary growth hormone, thyroid stimulating hormone, and most hormones of the gastrointestinal tract. Somatostatin also affects rates of neurotransmission in the central nervous system and proliferation of both normal and tumorigenic cells.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes the sacsin protein, which includes a UbL domain at the N-terminus, a DnaJ domain, and a HEPN domain at the C-terminus. The gene is highly expressed in the central nervous system, also found in skin, skeletal muscles and at low levels in the pancreas. This gene includes a very large exon spanning more than 12.8 kb. Mutations in this gene result in autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by early-onset cerebellar ataxia with spasticity and peripheral neuropathy. The authors of a publication on the effects of siRNA-mediated sacsin knockdown concluded that sacsin protects against mutant ataxin-1 and suggest that 'the large multi-domain sacsin protein is able to recruit Hsp70 chaperone action and has the potential to regulate the effects of other ataxia proteins' (Parfitt et al., PubMed: 19208651). A pseudogene associated with this gene is located on chromosome 11. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that is a member of the seven in absentia homolog (SIAH) family. The protein is an E3 ligase and is involved in ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation of specific proteins. The activity of this ubiquitin ligase has been implicated in the development of certain forms of Parkinson's disease, the regulation of the cellular response to hypoxia and induction of apoptosis. Alternative splicing results in several additional transcript variants, some encoding different isoforms and others that have not been fully characterized.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene is similar to SCARF1/SREC-I, a scavenger receptor protein that mediates the binding and degradation of acetylated low density lipoprotein (Ac-LDL). This protein has only little activity of internalizing modified low density lipoproteins (LDL), but it can interact with SCARF1 through its extracellular domain. The association of this protein with SCARF1 is suppressed by the presence of scavenger ligands. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been reported.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes one of the many voltage-gated sodium channel proteins. For proper functioning of neurons and muscles during action potentials, voltage-gated sodium channels direct sodium ion diffusion for membrane depolarization. This sodium channel protein has some atypical characteristics; the similarity between the human and mouse proteins is lower compared to other orthologous sodium channel pairs. Also, the S4 segments, which sense voltage changes, have fewer positive charged residues that in other sodium channels; domain 4 has fewer arginine and lysine residues compared to other sodium channel proteins. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants exist, but the full-length natures of all of them remain unknown.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene, a member of the SNW gene family, encodes a coactivator that enhances transcription from some Pol II promoters. This coactivator can bind to the ligand-binding domain of the vitamin D receptor and to retinoid receptors to enhance vitamin D-, retinoic acid-, estrogen-, and glucocorticoid-mediated gene expression. It can also function as a splicing factor by interacting with poly(A)-binding protein 2 to directly control the expression of muscle-specific genes at the transcriptional level. Finally, the protein may be involved in oncogenesis since it interacts with a region of SKI oncoproteins that is required for transforming activity. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is highly similar to the protein encoded by the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SEC14 gene. The SEC14 protein is a phophatidylinositol transfer protein that is essential for biogenesis of Golgi-derived transport vesicles, and thus is required for the export of yeast secretory proteins from the Golgi complex. The specific function of this protein has not yet been determined. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene binds copper and zinc ions and is one of two isozymes responsible for destroying free superoxide radicals in the body. The encoded isozyme is a soluble cytoplasmic protein, acting as a homodimer to convert naturally-occuring but harmful superoxide radicals to molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. The other isozyme is a mitochondrial protein. In addition, this protein contains an antimicrobial peptide that displays antibacterial, antifungal, and anti-MRSA activity against E. coli, E. faecalis, S. aureus, S. aureus MRSA LPV+, S. agalactiae, and yeast C. krusei. Mutations in this gene have been implicated as causes of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Rare transcript variants have been reported for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes one family member of vacuolar protein sorting 10 (VPS10) domain-containing receptor proteins. The VPS10 domain name comes from the yeast carboxypeptidase Y sorting receptor Vps10 protein. Members of this gene family are large with many exons but the CDS lengths are usually less than 3700 nt. Very large introns typically separate the exons encoding the VPS10 domain; the remaining exons are separated by much smaller-sized introns. These genes are strongly expressed in the central nervous system. Two of the five family members (sortilin and sortilin-related receptor) are synthesized as preproproteins; it is not yet known if this encoded protein is also a preproprotein. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a type-I receptor transmembrane protein that is a member of the vacuolar protein sorting 10 receptor family. Proteins of this family are defined by a vacuolar protein sorting 10 domain at the N-terminus. The N-terminal segment of this domain has a consensus motif for proprotein convertase processing, and the C-terminal segment of this domain is characterized by ten conserved cysteine residues. The vacuolar protein sorting 10 domain is followed by a leucine-rich segment, a transmembrane domain, and a short C-terminal cytoplasmic domain that interacts with adaptor molecules. The transcript is expressed at high levels in the brain, and candidate gene studies suggest that genetic variation in this gene is associated with Alzheimer's disease. Consistent with this observation, knockdown of the gene in cell culture results in an increase in amyloid precursor protein processing.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the STAT family of transcription factors. In response to cytokines and growth factors, STAT family members are phosphorylated by the receptor associated kinases, and then form homo- or heterodimers that translocate to the cell nucleus where they act as transcription activators. This protein mediates the signal transduction triggered by various cell ligands, such as IL2, IL4, CSF1, and different growth hormones. It has been shown to be involved in diverse biological processes, such as TCR signaling, apoptosis, adult mammary gland development, and sexual dimorphism of liver gene expression. This gene was found to fuse to retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RARA) gene in a small subset of acute promyelocytic leukemias (APLL). The dysregulation of the signaling pathways mediated by this protein may be the cause of the APLL.","Variant counts

This protein is activated by, and mediates the responses of many cell ligands, such as IL2, IL3, IL7 GM-CSF, erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, and different growth hormones. Activation of this protein in myeloma and lymphoma associated with a TEL/JAK2 gene fusion is independent of cell stimulus and has been shown to be essential for tumorigenesis. The mouse counterpart of this gene is found to induce the expression of BCL2L1/BCL-X(L), which suggests the antiapoptotic function of this gene in cells.

Summary
There are three proteins including thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), transthyretin and albumin responsible for carrying the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) in the bloodstream. This gene encodes the major thyroid hormone transport protein, TBG, in serum. It belongs to the serpin family in genomics, but the protein has no inhibitory function like many other members of the serpin family. Mutations in this gene result in TGB deficiency, which has been classified as partial deficiency, complete deficiency, and excess, based on the level of serum TBG. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found, but the full-length nature of these variants has not been determined.","Variant counts

Summary
Synaptopodin is an actin-associated protein that may play a role in actin-based cell shape and motility. The name synaptopodin derives from the protein's associations with postsynaptic densities and dendritic spines and with renal podocytes (Mundel et al., 1997 [PubMed 9314539]).","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the lipophilin subfamily, part of the uteroglobin superfamily, and is an ortholog of prostatein, the major secretory glycoprotein of the rat ventral prostate gland. This gene product represents one component of a heterodimeric molecule present in human tears whose elution profile is consistent with prostatein, a tetrameric molecule composed of three peptide components in heterodimers. Assuming that human lipophilins are the functional counterparts of prostatein, they may be transcriptionally regulated by steroid hormones, with the ability to bind androgens, other steroids and possibly bind and concentrate estramustine, a chemotherapeutic agent widely used for prostate cancer. Although the gene has been reported to be on chromosome 15, this sequence appears to be from a cluster of genes on chromosome 11 that includes mammaglobin 2.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the lipophilin subfamily, part of the uteroglobin superfamily, and is an ortholog of prostatein, the major secretory glycoprotein of the rat ventral prostate gland. Lipophilin gene products are widely expressed in normal tissues, especially in endocrine-responsive organs. Assuming that human lipophilins are the functional counterparts of prostatein, they may be transcriptionally regulated by steroid hormones, with the ability to bind androgens, other steroids and possibly bind and concentrate estramustine, a chemotherapeutic agent widely used for prostate cancer.

The uptake of nucleosides by transporters, such as SLC29A2, is essential for nucleotide synthesis by salvage pathways in cells that lack de novo biosynthetic pathways. Nucleoside transport also plays a key role in the regulation of many physiologic processes through its effect on adenosine concentration at the cell surface (Griffiths et al., 1997 [PubMed 9396714]).","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter family. The gene encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein that localizes to the plasma and mitochondrial membranes and mediates the cellular uptake of nucleosides from the surrounding medium. The protein is categorized as an equilibrative (as opposed to concentrative) transporter that is sensitive to inhibition by nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR). Nucleoside transporters are required for nucleotide synthesis in cells that lack de novo nucleoside synthesis pathways, and are also necessary for the uptake of cytotoxic nucleosides used for cancer and viral chemotherapies. Multiple alternatively spliced variants, encoding the same protein, have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is located within the Prader-Willi Syndrome critical region on chromosome 15. Transcripts produced from this gene initiate at an imprinting center and are paternally-imprinted. These transcripts may be bicistronic and also encode SNRPN (small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide N) from a downstream open reading frame. The small protein represented by this gene is encoded by an evolutionarily-conserved upstream open reading frame and is localized to the nucleus. Extensive alternative splicing and promoter usage occurs in this region and the full-length nature of some of these transcripts has not been determined. Alterations in the imprinting center are associated with parental imprint switch failure, which may cause Angelman syndrome or Prader-Willi syndrome.","Variant counts

The signal sequence receptor (SSR) is a glycosylated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane receptor associated with protein translocation across the ER membrane. The SSR consists of 2 subunits, a 34-kD glycoprotein encoded by this gene and a 22-kD glycoprotein. This gene generates several mRNA species as a result of complex alternative polyadenylation. This gene is unusual in that it utilizes arrays of polyA signal sequences that are mostly non-canonical. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Both long non-coding and protein-coding RNAs are transcribed from this gene, and they represent alternatively spliced transcript variants. This gene was initially defined as a non-coding RNA, which is a coactivator for several nuclear receptors (NRs) and is associated with breast cancer. It has now been found that this gene is involved in the regulation of many NR and non-NR activities, including metabolism, adipogenesis and chromatin organization. The long non-coding RNA transcripts interact with a variety of proteins, including the protein encoded by this gene. The encoded protein acts as a transcriptional repressor by binding to the non-coding RNA.","Variant counts

Summary
Voltage-gated sodium channels are transmembrane glycoprotein complexes composed of a large alpha subunit with 24 transmembrane domains and one or more regulatory beta subunits. They are responsible for the generation and propagation of action potentials in neurons and muscle. This gene encodes one member of the sodium channel alpha subunit gene family, and is highly expressed in nociceptive neurons of dorsal root ganglia and trigeminal ganglia. It mediates brain-derived neurotrophic factor-evoked membrane depolarization and is a major effector of peripheral inflammatory pain hypersensitivity. Mutations in this gene have been associated with hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type VII and familial episodic pain syndrome-3. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a membrane protein which belongs to the riboflavin transporter family. In humans, riboflavin must be obtained by intestinal absorption because it cannot be synthesized by the body. The water-soluble vitamin riboflavin is processed to the coenzymes flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) which then act as intermediaries in many cellular metabolic reactions. Paralogous members of the riboflavin transporter gene family are located on chromosomes 17 and 20. Unlike other members of this family, this gene has higher expression in brain tissue than small intestine. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants encoding the same protein. Mutations in this gene have been associated with Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome 2 - an autosomal recessive progressive neurologic disorder characterized by deafness, bulbar dysfunction, and axial and limb hypotonia.","Variant counts

Summary
Meiotic recombination and chromosome segregation require the formation of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in paired chromosome homologs. During meiosis in yeast, a meiotic recombination protein is covalently-linked to the 5' end of DSBs and is essential for the formation of DSBs. The protein encoded by this gene is similar in sequence and conserved features to the yeast meiotic recombination protein. The encoded protein belongs to the TOP6A protein family. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene, but the full-length nature of only two of them have been described.","Variant counts

Summary
Transcription of protein-coding genes can be reconstituted on naked DNA with only the general transcription factors and RNA polymerase II. However, this minimal system cannot transcribe DNA packaged into chromatin, indicating that accessory factors may facilitate access to DNA. One such factor, FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription), interacts specifically with histones H2A/H2B to effect nucleosome disassembly and transcription elongation. FACT is composed of an 80 kDa subunit and a 140 kDa subunit; this gene encodes the 140 kDa subunit.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a sal-like C2H2-type zinc-finger protein, and belongs to a family of evolutionarily conserved genes found in species as diverse as Drosophila, C. elegans, and vertebrates. Mutations in some of these genes are associated with congenital disorders in human, suggesting their importance in embryonic development. This protein binds to DNA methyltransferase 3 alpha (DNMT3A), and reduces DNMT3A-mediated CpG island methylation. It is suggested that silencing of this gene, resulting in acceleration of DNA methylation, may have a role in oncogenesis.","Variant counts

Summary
Temporally regulated transcription and translation of several testis-specific genes is required to initiate the series of molecular and morphological changes in the male germ cell lineage necessary for the formation of mature spermatozoa. This gene is a member of the SPANX family of cancer/testis-associated genes, which are located in a cluster on chromosome X. The SPANX genes encode differentially expressed testis-specific proteins that localize to various subcellular compartments. This particular gene encodes a sperm protein that is associated with the nucleus but, although a role in spermatogenesis is suggested, the specific function of this family member has not yet been determined. Polymorphisms in this gene may be associated with prostate cancer susceptibility.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that may modulate the transcriptional repression activities of death-associated protein 6 (DAXX), which interacts with histone deacetylase, core histones, and other histone-associated proteins. In mouse, the encoded protein binds to the putative leucine zipper domain of macroH2A1.2, a variant H2A histone that is enriched on inactivated X chromosomes. The BTB/POZ domain of this protein has been shown in other proteins to mediate transcriptional repression and to interact with components of histone deacetylase co-repressor complexes. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants encoding the same protein.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the nesprin family of genes, that encode KASH (Klarsicht, Anc-1, Syne Homology) domain-containing proteins. In addition to the KASH domain, this protein also contains a coiled-coil and leucine zipper region, a spectrin repeat, and a kinesin-1 binding region. This protein localizes to the outer nuclear membrane, and is part of the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex in the nuclear envelope. LINC complexes are formed by SUN (Sad1, UNC-84)-KASH pairs, and are thought to mechanically couple nuclear components to the cytoskeleton. Mutations in this gene have been associated with progressive high-frequency hearing loss. The absence of this protein in mice also caused hearing loss, and changes in hair cell morphology in the ears. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
Syntrophins are cytoplasmic peripheral membrane scaffold proteins that are components of the dystrophin-associated protein complex. This gene is a member of the syntrophin gene family and encodes the most common syntrophin isoform found in cardiac tissues. The N-terminal PDZ domain of this syntrophin protein interacts with the C-terminus of the pore-forming alpha subunit (SCN5A) of the cardiac sodium channel Nav1.5. This protein also associates cardiac sodium channels with the nitric oxide synthase-PMCA4b (plasma membrane Ca-ATPase subtype 4b) complex in cardiomyocytes. This gene is a susceptibility locus for Long-QT syndrome (LQT) - an inherited disorder associated with sudden cardiac death from arrhythmia - and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). This protein also associates with dystrophin and dystrophin-related proteins at the neuromuscular junction and alters intracellular calcium ion levels in muscle tissue.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene is similar to syntaxin-binding protein 5 and contains ten N-terminal WD40 repeats, four variable region WD40 repeats, and a C-terminal R-SNARE domain. Studies of the orthologous proteins in mouse and rat have shown that the encoded protein may inhibit exocytosis in neurosecretory cells, and may negatively regulate the secretion of insulin. A missense variant in this gene is likely the cause of an infantile-onset neurodegenerative disorder diagnosed in two siblings of consanguineous parents.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the synapsin gene family. Synapsins encode neuronal phosphoproteins which associate with the cytoplasmic surface of synaptic vesicles. Family members are characterized by common protein domains, and they are implicated in synaptogenesis and the modulation of neurotransmitter release, suggesting a potential role in several neuropsychiatric diseases. This member of the synapsin family encodes a neuron-specific phosphoprotein that selectively binds to small synaptic vesicles in the presynaptic nerve terminal. Polymorphisms in this gene are associated with abnormal presynaptic function and related neuronal disorders, including autism, epilepsy, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants. The tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 4 gene is located within an intron of this gene and is transcribed in the opposite direction.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the Smad family of signal transduction proteins. Smad proteins are phosphorylated and activated by transmembrane serine-threonine receptor kinases in response to transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta signaling. The product of this gene forms homomeric complexes and heteromeric complexes with other activated Smad proteins, which then accumulate in the nucleus and regulate the transcription of target genes. This protein binds to DNA and recognizes an 8-bp palindromic sequence (GTCTAGAC) called the Smad-binding element (SBE). The protein acts as a tumor suppressor and inhibits epithelial cell proliferation. It may also have an inhibitory effect on tumors by reducing angiogenesis and increasng blood vessel hyperpermeability. The encoded protein is a crucial component of the bone morphogenetic protein signaling pathway. The Smad proteins are subject to complex regulation by post-translational modifications. Mutations or deletions in this gene have been shown to result in pancreatic cancer, juvenile polyposis syndrome, and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a nuclear protein that binds the E3 ubiquitin ligase SMURF2. Upon binding, this complex translocates to the cytoplasm, where it interacts with TGF-beta receptor type-1 (TGFBR1), leading to the degradation of both the encoded protein and TGFBR1. Expression of this gene is induced by TGFBR1. Variations in this gene are a cause of susceptibility to colorectal cancer type 3 (CRCS3). Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the SMAD, a family of proteins similar to the gene products of the Drosophila gene 'mothers against decapentaplegic' (Mad) and the C. elegans gene Sma. SMAD proteins are signal transducers and transcriptional modulators that mediate multiple signaling pathways. This protein mediates the signals of the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), which are involved in a range of biological activities including cell growth, apoptosis, morphogenesis, development and immune responses. In response to BMP ligands, this protein can be phosphorylated and activated by the BMP receptor kinase. The phosphorylated form of this protein forms a complex with SMAD4, which is important for its function in the transcription regulation. This protein is a target for SMAD-specific E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as SMURF1 and SMURF2, and undergoes ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein have been observed.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the SMAD, a family of proteins similar to the gene products of the Drosophila gene 'mothers against decapentaplegic' (Mad) and the C. elegans gene Sma. SMAD proteins are signal transducers and transcriptional modulators that mediate multiple signaling pathways. This protein mediates the signal of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, and thus regulates multiple cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. This protein is recruited to the TGF-beta receptors through its interaction with the SMAD anchor for receptor activation (SARA) protein. In response to TGF-beta signal, this protein is phosphorylated by the TGF-beta receptors. The phosphorylation induces the dissociation of this protein with SARA and the association with the family member SMAD4. The association with SMAD4 is important for the translocation of this protein into the nucleus, where it binds to target promoters and forms a transcription repressor complex with other cofactors. This protein can also be phosphorylated by activin type 1 receptor kinase, and mediates the signal from the activin. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been observed for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the homeobox family of genes that encode proteins containing a 60-amino acid residue motif that represents a DNA binding domain. Homeobox genes have been characterized extensively as transcriptional regulators involved in pattern formation in both invertebrate and vertebrate species. Several human genetic disorders are caused by aberrations in human homeobox genes. This locus represents a pseudoautosomal homeobox gene that is thought to be responsible for idiopathic short stature, and it is implicated in the short stature phenotype of Turner syndrome patients. This gene is considered to be a candidate gene for Cornelia de Lange syndrome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is the predominant protein in semen. The encoded secreted protein is involved in the formation of a gel matrix that encases ejaculated spermatozoa. This preproprotein is proteolytically processed by the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) protease to generate multiple peptide products that exhibit distinct functions. One of these peptides, SgI-29, is an antimicrobial peptide with antibacterial activity. This proteolysis process also breaks down the gel matrix and allows the spermatozoa to move more freely. This gene and another similar semenogelin gene are present in a gene cluster on chromosome 20.","Variant counts

Summary
Spectrins are principle components of a cell's membrane-cytoskeleton and are composed of two alpha and two beta spectrin subunits. The protein encoded by this gene (SPTBN2), is called spectrin beta non-erythrocytic 2 or beta-III spectrin. It is related to, but distinct from, the beta-II spectrin gene which is also known as spectrin beta non-erythrocytic 1 (SPTBN1). SPTBN2 regulates the glutamate signaling pathway by stabilizing the glutamate transporter EAAT4 at the surface of the plasma membrane. Mutations in this gene cause a form of spinocerebellar ataxia, SCA5, that is characterized by neurodegeneration, progressive locomotor incoordination, dysarthria, and uncoordinated eye movements.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a large, transmembrane receptor protein which may function in angiogenesis, lymphocyte homing, cell adhesion, or receptor scavenging. The protein contains 7 fasciclin, 16 epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like, and 2 laminin-type EGF-like domains as well as a C-type lectin-like hyaluronan-binding Link module. The protein is primarily expressed on sinusoidal endothelial cells of liver, spleen, and lymph node. The receptor has been shown to endocytose ligands such as low density lipoprotein, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and advanced glycosylation end products. Supporting its possible role as a scavenger receptor, the protein rapidly cycles between the plasma membrane and early endosomes.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene shares homology with Src kinase-associated phosphoprotein 1, and is a substrate of Src family kinases. It is an adaptor protein that is thought to play an essential role in the Src signaling pathway, and in regulating proper activation of the immune system. This protein contains an amino terminal coiled-coil domain for self-dimerization, a plecskstrin homology (PH) domain required for interactions with lipids at the membrane, and a Src homology (SH3) domain at the carboxy terminus. Some reports indicate that this protein inhibits actin polymerization through interactions with actin assembly factors, and might negatively regulate the invasiveness of tumors by modulating actin assembly. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a T cell adaptor protein, a class of intracellular molecules with modular domains capable of recruiting additional proteins but that exhibit no intrinsic enzymatic activity. The encoded protein contains a unique N-terminal region followed by a PH domain and C-terminal SH3 domain. Along with the adhesion and degranulation-promoting adaptor protein, the encoded protein plays a critical role in inside-out signaling by coupling T-cell antigen receptor stimulation to the activation of integrins.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a receptor protein that interacts with a variety of psychotomimetic drugs, including cocaine and amphetamines. The receptor is believed to play an important role in the cellular functions of various tissues associated with the endocrine, immune, and nervous systems. As indicated by its previous name, opioid receptor sigma 1 (OPRS1), the product of this gene was erroneously thought to function as an opioid receptor; it is now thought to be a non-opioid receptor. Mutations in this gene has been associated with juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 16. Alternative splicing of this gene results in transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.","Variant counts

This gene encodes several androgen-dependent, epididymis-specific secretory proteins. The specific functions of these proteins have not been determined, but they are thought to be involved in sperm maturation. Some of the isoforms contain regions of similarity to beta-defensins, a family of antimicrobial peptides. The gene is located on chromosome 8p23 near the defensin gene cluster. Alternative splicing of this gene results in seven transcript variants encoding different isoforms. Two different N-terminal and five different C-terminal protein sequences are encoded by the splice variants. Two additional variants have been described, but their full length sequences have not been determined.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene is part of the large ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex SWI/SNF, which is required for transcriptional activation of genes normally repressed by chromatin. The encoded protein, either alone or when in the SWI/SNF complex, can bind to 4-way junction DNA, which is thought to mimic the topology of DNA as it enters or exits the nucleosome. The protein contains a DNA-binding HMG domain, but disruption of this domain does not abolish the DNA-binding or nucleosome-displacement activities of the SWI/SNF complex. Unlike most of the SWI/SNF complex proteins, this protein has no yeast counterpart.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene belongs to the serpin gene superfamily. Serpins play roles in many processes including inflammation, blood clotting, and cancer metastasis. Members of this family have highly conserved secondary structures with a reactive center loop that interacts with the protease active site to inhibit protease activity. This gene encodes a plasma serine protease that functions as a thrombin and chymotrypsin inhibitor. The protein is activated by heparin, dermatan sulfate, and glycosaminoglycans. Allelic variations in this gene are associated with heparin cofactor II deficiency.","Variant counts

Summary
Sulfotransferase enzymes catalyze the sulfate conjugation of many hormones, neurotransmitters, drugs, and xenobiotic compounds. These cytosolic enzymes are different in their tissue distributions and substrate specificities. The gene structure (number and length of exons) is similar among family members. This gene sulfates dehydroepiandrosterone but not 4-nitrophenol, a typical substrate for the phenol and estrogen sulfotransferase subfamilies. Two alternatively spliced variants that encode different isoforms have been described.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is an isozyme of long-chain fatty-acid-coenzyme A ligase family. Although differing in substrate specificity, subcellular localization, and tissue distribution, all isozymes of this family convert free long-chain fatty acids into fatty acyl-CoA esters, and thereby play a key role in lipid biosynthesis and fatty acid degradation. This isozyme activates long-chain, branched-chain and very-long-chain fatty acids containing 22 or more carbons to their CoA derivatives. It is expressed primarily in liver and kidney, and is present in both endoplasmic reticulum and peroxisomes, but not in mitochondria. Its decreased peroxisomal enzyme activity is in part responsible for the biochemical pathology in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

The F-box proteins constitute one of the four subunits of ubiquitin protein ligase complex called SCFs (SKP1-cullin-F-box), which function in phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination. The F-box proteins are divided into 3 classes: Fbws containing WD-40 domains, Fbls containing leucine-rich repeats, and Fbxs containing either different protein-protein interaction modules or no recognizable motifs. The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the Fbls class; in addition to an F-box, this protein contains 10 tandem leucine-rich repeats. This protein is an essential element of the cyclin A-CDK2 S-phase kinase. It specifically recognizes phosphorylated cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (CDKN1B, also referred to as p27 or KIP1) predominantly in S phase and interacts with S-phase kinase-associated protein 1 (SKP1 or p19). In addition, this gene is established as a protooncogene causally involved in the pathogenesis of lymphomas. Alternative splicing of this gene generates three transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a component of SCF complexes, which are composed of this protein, cullin 1, a ring-box protein, and one member of the F-box family of proteins. This protein binds directly to the F-box motif found in F-box proteins. SCF complexes are involved in the regulated ubiquitination of specific protein substrates, which targets them for degradation by the proteosome. Specific F-box proteins recognize different target protein(s), and many specific SCF substrates have been identified including regulators of cell cycle progression and development. Studies have also characterized the protein as an RNA polymerase II elongation factor. Alternative splicing of this gene results in two transcript variants. A related pseudogene has been identified on chromosome 7.","Variant counts

Summary
SUN1 (MIM 607723) and SUN2 are inner nuclear membrane (INM) proteins that play a major role in nuclear-cytoplasmic connection by formation of a 'bridge' across the nuclear envelope, known as the LINC complex, via interaction with the conserved luminal KASH domain of nesprins (e.g., SYNE1; MIM 608441) located in the outer nuclear membrane (ONM). The LINC complex provides a direct connection between the nuclear lamina and the cytoskeleton, which contributes to nuclear positioning and cellular rigidity (summary by Haque et al., 2010 [PubMed 19933576]).","Variant counts

Members of the SLITRK family, such as SLITRK5, are integral membrane proteins with 2 N-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains similar to those of SLIT proteins (see SLIT1; MIM 603742). Most SLITRKs, including SLITRK5, also have C-terminal regions that share homology with neurotrophin receptors (see NTRK1; MIM 191315). SLITRKs are expressed predominantly in neural tissues and have neurite-modulating activity (Aruga et al., 2003 [PubMed 14557068]).","Variant counts

Summary
Cholesterol homeostasis is regulated, at least in part, by sterol regulatory element (SRE)-binding proteins (e.g., SREBP1; MIM 184756) and by liver X receptors (e.g., LXRA; MIM 602423). Upon sterol depletion, LXRs are inactive and SREBPs are cleaved, after which they bind promoter SREs and activate genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and uptake. Sterol transport is mediated by vesicles or by soluble protein carriers, such as steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (STAR; MIM 600617). STAR is homologous to a family of proteins containing a 200- to 210-amino acid STAR-related lipid transfer (START) domain, including STARD4 (Soccio et al., 2002 [PubMed 12011452]).","Variant counts

Summary
Proteins containing a steroidogenic acute regulatory-related lipid transfer (START) domain are often involved in the trafficking of lipids and cholesterol between diverse intracellular membranes. This gene is a member of the StarD subfamily that encodes START-related lipid transfer proteins. The protein encoded by this gene is a cholesterol transporter and is also able to bind and transport other sterol-derived molecules related to the cholesterol/bile acid biosynthetic pathways such as 25-hydroxycholesterol. Its expression is upregulated during endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The protein is thought to act as a cytosolic sterol transporter that moves cholesterol between intracellular membranes such as from the cytoplasm to the ER and from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. Alternative splicing of this gene produces multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
Polyamines are ubiquitous polycationic alkylamines which include spermine, spermidine, putrescine, and agmatine. These molecules participate in a broad range of cellular functions which include cell cycle modulation, scavenging reactive oxygen species, and the control of gene expression. These molecules also play important roles in neurotransmission through their regulation of cell-surface receptor activity, involvement in intracellular signalling pathways, and their putative roles as neurotransmitters. This gene encodes an FAD-containing enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of spermine to spermadine and secondarily produces hydrogen peroxide. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoenzymes have been identified for this gene, some of which have failed to demonstrate significant oxidase activity on natural polyamine substrates. The characterized isoenzymes have distinctive biochemical characteristics and substrate specificities, suggesting the existence of additional levels of complexity in polyamine catabolism.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a seizure-related protein that is localized on the cell surface. The gene is located in a region of chromosome 16p11.2 that is thought to contain candidate genes for autism spectrum disorders (ASD), though there is no evidence directly implicating this gene in ASD. Increased expression of this gene has been found in lung cancers, and the protein is therefore considered to be a novel prognostic marker for lung cancer. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that is an important regulator of genome stability. The protein represents the catalytic subunit of the SLX1-SLX4 structure-specific endonuclease, which can resolve DNA secondary structures that are formed during repair and recombination processes. Two identical copies of this gene are located on the p arm of chromosome 16 due to a segmental duplication; this record represents the more telomeric copy. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Read-through transcription also occurs between this gene and the downstream SULT1A4 (sulfotransferase family, cytosolic, 1A, phenol-preferring, member 4) gene.","Variant counts

Summary
In cardiac myocytes, Ca(2+) concentrations alternate between high levels during contraction and low levels during relaxation. The increase in Ca(2+) concentration during contraction is primarily due to release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores. However, some Ca(2+) also enters the cell through the sarcolemma (plasma membrane). During relaxation, Ca(2+) is sequestered within the intracellular stores. To prevent overloading of intracellular stores, the Ca(2+) that entered across the sarcolemma must be extruded from the cell. The Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger is the primary mechanism by which the Ca(2+) is extruded from the cell during relaxation. In the heart, the exchanger may play a key role in digitalis action. The exchanger is the dominant mechanism in returning the cardiac myocyte to its resting state following excitation.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene shares similarity with the yeast Sec31 protein, and is a component of the outer layer of the coat protein complex II (COPII). The encoded protein is involved in vesicle budding from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and contains multiple WD repeats near the N-terminus and a proline-rich region in the C-terminal half. It associates with the protein encoded by the SEC13 homolog, nuclear pore and COPII coat complex component (SEC13), and is required for ER-Golgi transport. Monoubiquitylation of this protein by CUL3-KLHL12 was found to regulate the size of COPII coats to accommodate unusually shaped cargo. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is expressed in the brain, predominantly in the parietal and frontal cortex as well as in dorsal root ganglia. It is localized to the peroxisome, and is implicated in resistance to oxidative stress. It likely functions by increasing superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, but itself has no direct SOD activity. Studies in mice show that this gene confers low seizure threshold, and may also enhance epileptogenesis.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a small GTPase that acts as a homodimer. The encoded protein is activated by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor PREB and is involved in protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi. This protein is part of the COPII coat complex. Defects in this gene are a cause of chylomicron retention disease (CMRD), also known as Anderson disease (ANDD). Two transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the synaptotagmin-like (Slp) protein family, which contains a unique homology domain at the N-terminus, referred to as the Slp homology domain (SHD). The SHD functions as a binding site for Rab27A, which plays a role in protein transport. Expression of this gene is restricted to placenta and liver, suggesting that it might be involved in Rab27A-dependent membrane trafficking in specific tissues. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a bipartite protein with distinct amino- and carboxy-terminal domains. The amino-terminus contains nuclear localization signals and the carboxy-terminus contains numerous consecutive sequences with extensive similarity to proteins in the gelsolin family of actin-binding proteins, which cap, nucleate, and/or sever actin filaments. The gene product is tightly associated with both actin filaments and plasma membranes, suggesting a role as a high-affinity link between the actin cytoskeleton and the membrane. The encoded protein appears to aid in both myosin II assembly during cell spreading and disassembly of focal adhesions. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms of supervillin have been described.","Variant counts

Summary
The correlation of anti-sperm antibodies with cases of unexplained infertility implicates a role for these antibodies in blocking fertilization. Improved diagnosis and treatment of immunologic infertility, as well as identification of proteins for targeted contraception, are dependent on the identification and characterization of relevant sperm antigens. The protein expressed by this gene is recognized by anti-sperm agglutinating antibodies from an infertile woman. Furthermore, immunization of female rats with the recombinant human protein reduced fertility. This protein localizes to the plasma membrane of germ cells in the testis and to the post-acrosomal plasma membrane of mature spermatozoa. Recombinant polypeptide binds GTP and exhibits GTPase activity. Thus, this protein may regulate GTP signal transduction pathways involved in spermatogenesis and fertilization. Two transcript variants of this gene encode the same protein.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the organic anion transporter family. The encoded protein is a transmembrane receptor that mediates the sodium-independent uptake of thyroid hormones in brain tissues. This protein has particularly high affinity for the thyroid hormones thyroxine, tri-iodothyronine and reverse tri-iodothyronine. Polymorphisms in the gene encoding this protein may be associated with fatigue and depression in patients suffering from hyperthyroidism. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
Complex II of the respiratory chain, which is specifically involved in the oxidation of succinate, carries electrons from FADH to CoQ. The complex is composed of four nuclear-encoded subunits and is localized in the mitochondrial inner membrane. The iron-sulfur subunit is highly conserved and contains three cysteine-rich clusters which may comprise the iron-sulfur centers of the enzyme. Sporadic and familial mutations in this gene result in paragangliomas and pheochromocytoma, and support a link between mitochondrial dysfunction and tumorigenesis.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of complex II of the respiratory chain, which is responsible for the oxidation of succinate. The encoded protein is one of two integral membrane proteins anchoring the complex to the matrix side of the mitochondrial inner membrane. Mutations in this gene are associated with the formation of tumors, including hereditary paraganglioma. Transmission of disease occurs almost exclusively through the paternal allele, suggesting that this locus may be maternally imprinted. There are pseudogenes for this gene on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 7, and 18. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that is an important regulator of genome stability. The protein represents the catalytic subunit of the SLX1-SLX4 structure-specific endonuclease, which can resolve DNA secondary structures that are formed during repair and recombination processes. Two identical copies of this gene are located on the p arm of chromosome 16 due to a segmental duplication; this record represents the more centromeric copy. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that is essential for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD); a process whereby transcripts with premature termination codons are targeted for rapid degradation by a mRNA decay complex. The mRNA decay complex consists, in part, of this protein along with proteins SMG5 and UPF1. The N-terminal domain of this protein is thought to mediate its association with SMG5 or UPF1 while the C-terminal domain interacts with the mRNA decay complex. This protein may therefore couple changes in UPF1 phosphorylation state to the degradation of NMD-candidate transcripts. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a ubiquitously expressed transmembrane thiamine transporter that lacks folate transport activity. Mutations in this gene cause biotin-responsive basal ganglia disease (BBGD); a recessive disorder manifested in childhood that progresses to chronic encephalopathy, dystonia, quadriparesis, and death if untreated. Patients with BBGD have bilateral necrosis in the head of the caudate nucleus and in the putamen. Administration of high doses of biotin in the early progression of the disorder eliminates pathological symptoms while delayed treatment results in residual paraparesis, mild cognitive disability, or dystonia. Administration of thiamine is ineffective in the treatment of this disorder. Experiments have failed to show that this protein can transport biotin. Mutations in this gene also cause a Wernicke's-like encephalopathy.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a single-transmembrane protein which is one of nine members of a family of transmembrane adaptors that modulate both WNT and FGF signaling by blocking the maturation and transport of their receptors to the cell surface. Members of this family contain an N-terminal cysteine-rich domain with a distinct cysteine pattern, a single transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal proline-rich, low complexity region. The encoded protein acts as a tumor suppressor by accelerating beta-catenin degradation.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a nuclear protein that functions in the regulation of polyadenylation and promotes gene expression. The protein forms a high-molecular weight complex with components of the polyadenylation machinery. It is thought to serve as a scaffold for recruiting regulatory factors to the polyadenylation complex. It also participates in 3'-end maturation of histone mRNAs, which do not undergo polyadenylation. The protein also localizes to the cytoplasmic plaques of tight junctions in some cell types.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the SOX (SRY-related HMG-box) family of transcription factors involved in the regulation of embryonic development and in the determination of the cell fate. The encoded protein acts as a transcriptional regulator when present in a complex with other proteins. It can activate p53 transcription to promote tumor cell apoptosis in lung cancer. The protein may be involved in the differentiation of developing male germ cells. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants. A related pseudogene has been identified on chromosome 5.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene, antithrombin III, is a plasma protease inhibitor and a member of the serpin superfamily. This protein inhibits thrombin as well as other activated serine proteases of the coagulation system, and it regulates the blood coagulation cascade. The protein includes two functional domains: the heparin binding-domain at the N-terminus of the mature protein, and the reactive site domain at the C-terminus. The inhibitory activity is enhanced by the presence of heparin. Numerous mutations have been identified for this gene, many of which are known to cause antithrombin-III deficiency which constitutes a strong risk factor for thrombosis. A reduction in the serum level of this protein is associated with severe cases of Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19).","Variant counts

Summary
Sphingomyelin, a major component of cell and Golgi membranes, is made by the transfer of phosphocholine from phosphatidylcholine onto ceramide, with diacylglycerol as a side product. The protein encoded by this gene is an enzyme that catalyzes this reaction primarily at the cell membrane. The synthesis is reversible, and this enzyme can catalyze the reaction in either direction. The encoded protein is required for cell growth. Three transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found for this gene. There is evidence for more variants, but the full-length nature of their transcripts has not been determined.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the selenium-binding protein family. Selenium is an essential nutrient that exhibits potent anticarcinogenic properties, and deficiency of selenium may cause certain neurologic diseases. The effects of selenium in preventing cancer and neurologic diseases may be mediated by selenium-binding proteins, and decreased expression of this gene may be associated with several types of cancer. The encoded protein may play a selenium-dependent role in ubiquitination/deubiquitination-mediated protein degradation. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene.","Variant counts

This gene product is one of several closely related mitochondrial-membrane carrier proteins that shuttle substrates between cytosol and the intramitochondrial matrix space. This protein mediates the transport of acylcarnitines into mitochondrial matrix for their oxidation by the mitochondrial fatty acid-oxidation pathway. Mutations in this gene are associated with carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency, which can cause a variety of pathological conditions such as hypoglycemia, cardiac arrest, hepatomegaly, hepatic dysfunction and muscle weakness, and is usually lethal in new born and infants.","Variant counts

Summary
Mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCP) are members of the larger family of mitochondrial anion carrier proteins (MACP). UCPs separate oxidative phosphorylation from ATP synthesis with energy dissipated as heat, also referred to as the mitochondrial proton leak. UCPs facilitate the transfer of anions from the inner to the outer mitochondrial membrane and the return transfer of protons from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane. They also reduce the mitochondrial membrane potential in mammalian cells. Tissue specificity occurs for the different UCPs and the exact methods of how UCPs transfer H+/OH- are not known. UCPs contain the three homologous protein domains of MACPs. Transcripts of this gene are only detected in brain tissue and are specifically modulated by various environmental conditions. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein that is a member of the large family of solute carrier family 25 (SLC25) mitochondrial transporters. The members of this superfamily are involved in numerous metabolic pathways and cell functions. This gene product was previously reported to be a mitochondrial carnitine-acylcarnitine-like (CACL) translocase (PMID:128829710) or an ornithine transporter (designated ORNT3, PMID:19287344), however, a recent study characterized the main role of this protein as a mitochondrial transporter of basic amino acids, with a preference for arginine and lysine (PMID:24652292). Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the sorting nexin family. Members of this family contain a phox (PX) domain, which is a phosphoinositide binding domain, and are involved in intracellular trafficking. This protein does not contain a coiled coil region, like some family members, but contains a B41 domain. This protein interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of P-selectin, and may function in the intracellular trafficking of P-selectin. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the sorting nexin family. Members of this family contain a phox (PX) domain, which is a phosphoinositide binding domain, and are involved in intracellular trafficking. Overexpression of this gene results in a decrease in the processing of insulin and hepatocyte growth factor receptors to their mature subunits. This decrease is caused by the mislocalization of furin, the endoprotease responsible for cleavage of insulin and hepatocyte growth factor receptors. This protein is involved in endosomal trafficking from the plasma membrane to recycling endosomes or the trans-Golgi network. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Read-through transcription also exists between this gene and the upstream ADP-ribosylation factor-like 2 (ARL2) gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a PHOX domain- and RGS domain-containing protein that belongs to the sorting nexin (SNX) family and the regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) family. The PHOX domain is a phosphoinositide binding domain, and the SNX family members are involved in intracellular trafficking. The RGS family members are regulatory molecules that act as GTPase activating proteins for G alpha subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. The RGS domain of this protein interacts with G alpha(s), accelerates its GTP hydrolysis, and attenuates G alpha(s)-mediated signaling. Overexpression of this protein delayes lysosomal degradation of the epidermal growth factor receptor. Because of its bifunctional role, this protein may link heterotrimeric G protein signaling and vesicular trafficking.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the sestrin family. Sestrins are induced by the p53 tumor suppressor protein and play a role in the cellular response to DNA damage and oxidative stress. The encoded protein mediates p53 inhibition of cell growth by activating AMP-activated protein kinase, which results in the inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin protein. The encoded protein also plays a critical role in antioxidant defense by regenerating overoxidized peroxiredoxins, and the expression of this gene is a potential marker for exposure to radiation. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the slit family of secreted glycoproteins, which are ligands for the Robo family of immunoglobulin receptors. Slit proteins play highly conserved roles in axon guidance and neuronal migration and may also have functions during other cell migration processes including leukocyte migration. Members of the slit family are characterized by an N-terminal signal peptide, four leucine-rich repeats, nine epidermal growth factor repeats, and a C-terminal cysteine knot. Proteolytic processing of this protein gives rise to an N-terminal fragment that contains the four leucine-rich repeats and five epidermal growth factor repeats and a C-terminal fragment that contains four epidermal growth factor repeats and the cysteine knot. Both full length and cleaved proteins are secreted extracellularly and can function in axon repulsion as well as other specific processes. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
Sorbitol dehydrogenase (SORD; EC 1.1.1.14) catalyzes the interconversion of polyols and their corresponding ketoses, and together with aldose reductase (ALDR1; MIM 103880), makes up the sorbitol pathway that is believed to play an important role in the development of diabetic complications (summarized by Carr and Markham, 1995 [PubMed 8535074]). The first reaction of the pathway (also called the polyol pathway) is the reduction of glucose to sorbitol by ALDR1 with NADPH as the cofactor. SORD then oxidizes the sorbitol to fructose using NAD(+) cofactor.","Variant counts

Higher expression of this protein has also been reported in brain, breast, lung and ovarian tumors, compared to the corresponding normal tissues, and it shows better tumor-association than other cancer-associated molecules, making it a more suitable target for developing specific cancer therapies. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a transmembrane protein that is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It is involved in the degradation process of misfolded proteins in the ER, and may also have a role in inflammation control. This protein is a selenoprotein, containing the rare amino acid selenocysteine (Sec). Sec is encoded by the UGA codon, which normally signals translation termination. The 3' UTRs of selenoprotein mRNAs contain a conserved stem-loop structure, designated the Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element, that is necessary for the recognition of UGA as a Sec codon, rather than as a stop signal. Two additional phylogenetically conserved stem-loop structures (Stem-loop 1 and Stem-loop 2) in the 3' UTR of this mRNA have been shown to function as modulators of Sec insertion. An alternatively spliced transcript variant, lacking the SECIS element and encoding a non-Sec containing shorter isoform, has been described for this gene (PMID:23614019).","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a selenoprotein that is predominantly expressed in the liver and secreted into the plasma. This selenoprotein is unique in that it contains multiple selenocysteine (Sec) residues per polypeptide (10 in human), and accounts for most of the selenium in plasma. It has been implicated as an extracellular antioxidant, and in the transport of selenium to extra-hepatic tissues via apolipoprotein E receptor-2 (apoER2). Mice lacking this gene exhibit neurological dysfunction, suggesting its importance in normal brain function. Sec is encoded by the UGA codon, which normally signals translation termination. The 3' UTRs of selenoprotein mRNAs contain a conserved stem-loop structure, designated the Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element, that is necessary for the recognition of UGA as a Sec codon, rather than as a stop signal. The mRNA for this selenoprotein contains two SECIS elements. The use of alternative polyadenylation sites, one located in between the two SECIS elements, results in two populations of mRNAs containing either both (predominant) or just the upstream SECIS element (PMID:27881738). Alternatively spliced transcript variants have also been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a glycoprotein that is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. It plays an important role in cell protection against oxidative stress, and in the regulation of redox-related calcium homeostasis. Mutations in this gene are associated with early onset muscle disorders, referred to as SEPN1-related myopathy. SEPN1-related myopathy consists of 4 autosomal recessive disorders, originally thought to be separate entities: rigid spine muscular dystrophy (RSMD1), the classical form of multiminicore disease, desmin related myopathy with Mallory-body like inclusions, and congenital fiber-type disproportion (CFTD). This protein is a selenoprotein, containing the rare amino acid selenocysteine (Sec). Sec is encoded by the UGA codon, which normally signals translation termination. The 3' UTRs of selenoprotein mRNAs contain a conserved stem-loop structure, designated the Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element, that is necessary for the recognition of UGA as a Sec codon, rather than as a stop signal. A second stop-codon redefinition element (SRE) adjacent to the UGA codon has been identified in this gene (PMID:15791204). SRE is a phylogenetically conserved stem-loop structure that stimulates readthrough at the UGA codon, and augments the Sec insertion efficiency by SECIS. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene inhibits acetylation of nucleosomes, especially histone H4, by histone acetylases (HAT). This inhibition is most likely accomplished by masking histone lysines from being acetylated, and the consequence is to silence HAT-dependent transcription. The encoded protein is part of a complex localized to the endoplasmic reticulum but is found in the nucleus and inhibits apoptosis following attack by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. This protein can also enhance DNA replication of the adenovirus genome. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Huntington's disease (HD), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of striatal neurons, is caused by an expansion of a polyglutamine tract in the HD protein huntingtin. This gene encodes a protein belonging to a class of huntingtin interacting proteins characterized by WW motifs. This protein is a histone methyltransferase that is specific for lysine-36 of histone H3, and methylation of this residue is associated with active chromatin. This protein also contains a novel transcriptional activation domain and has been found associated with hyperphosphorylated RNA polymerase II.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the synapsin gene family. Synapsins encode neuronal phosphoproteins which associate with the cytoplasmic surface of synaptic vesicles. Family members are characterized by common protein domains, and they are implicated in synaptogenesis and the modulation of neurotransmitter release, suggesting a potential role in several neuropsychiatric diseases. The protein encoded by this gene shares the synapsin family domain model, with domains A, C, and E exhibiting the highest degree of conservation. The protein contains a unique domain J, located between domains C and E. Based on this gene's localization to 22q12.3, a possible schizophrenia susceptibility locus, and the established neurobiological roles of the synapsins, this family member may represent a candidate gene for schizophrenia. The TIMP3 gene is located within an intron of this gene and is transcribed in the opposite direction. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple splice variants that encode different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is one of the essential components of the machinery involved in co-translational insertion of selenocysteine (Sec) into selenoproteins. Sec is encoded by the UGA codon, which normally signals translation termination. The recoding of UGA as Sec codon requires a Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element; present in the 3' untranslated regions of eukaryotic selenoprotein mRNAs. This protein specifically binds to the SECIS element, which is stimulated by a Sec-specific translation elongation factor. Mutations in this gene have been associated with reduction in enzymatic activity of type II iodothyronine deiodinase (a selenoprotein) and abnormal thyroid hormone metabolism. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the superoxide dismutase (SOD) protein family. SODs are antioxidant enzymes that catalyze the conversion of superoxide radicals into hydrogen peroxide and oxygen, which may protect the brain, lungs, and other tissues from oxidative stress. Proteolytic processing of the encoded protein results in the formation of two distinct homotetramers that differ in their ability to interact with the extracellular matrix (ECM). Homotetramers consisting of the intact protein, or type C subunit, exhibit high affinity for heparin and are anchored to the ECM. Homotetramers consisting of a proteolytically cleaved form of the protein, or type A subunit, exhibit low affinity for heparin and do not interact with the ECM. A mutation in this gene may be associated with increased heart disease risk.","Variant counts

Summary
The ADF (actin-depolymerizing factor)/cofilin family (see MIM 601442) is composed of stimulus-responsive mediators of actin dynamics. ADF/cofilin proteins are inactivated by kinases such as LIM domain kinase-1 (LIMK1; MIM 601329). The SSH family appears to play a role in actin dynamics by reactivating ADF/cofilin proteins in vivo (Niwa et al., 2002 [PubMed 11832213]).","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the slingshot homolog (SSH) family of phosphatases, which regulate actin filament dynamics. The SSH proteins dephosphorylate and activate the actin binding/depolymerizing factor cofilin, which subsequently binds to actin filaments and stimulates their disassembly. Cofilin is inactivated by kinases such as LIM domain kinase-1 (LIMK1), which may also be dephosphorylated and inactivated by SSH proteins. The SSH family thus appears to play a role in actin dynamics by reactivating cofilin proteins. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene contains a proline-rich region, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and a region in the carboxy terminal half with similarity to the Src Homology 2 (SH2) domain. This protein is a substrate of tyrosine-protein kinase Tec, and its interaction with tyrosine-protein kinase Tec is phosphorylation-dependent. This protein is thought to participate in a positive feedback loop by upregulating the activity of tyrosine-protein kinase Tec. Variants of this gene have been associated with autosomal-dominant hypercholesterolemia (ADH), which is characterized by elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and in increased risk of coronary vascular disease. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the sodium/bile acid cotransporter family, which are integral membrane glycoproteins that participate in the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids. Two homologous transporters are involved in the reabsorption of bile acids; the ileal sodium/bile acid cotransporter with an apical cell localization that absorbs bile acids from the intestinal lumen, bile duct and kidney, and the liver-specific sodium/bile acid cotransporter, represented by this protein, that is found in the basolateral membranes of hepatocytes. Bile acids are the catabolic product of cholesterol metabolism, hence this protein is important for cholesterol homeostasis.","Variant counts

Summary
The correlation of anti-sperm antibodies with cases of unexplained infertility implicates a role for these antibodies in blocking fertilization. Improved diagnosis and treatment of immunologic infertility, as well as identification of proteins for targeted contraception, are dependent on the identification and characterization of relevant sperm antigens. The protein encoded by this gene is recognized by sperm agglutinating antibodies from an infertile woman. This protein is localized in germ cells of the testis at all stages of spermatogenesis and is localized to the acrosomal region of mature spermatozoa. This protein interacts with ACT (activator of CREM in testis) and may play a role in CREM (cAMP response element modulator)-ACT-mediated gene transcription during spermatogenesis. This protein may also play a role in spermatogenesis by regulating microtubule formation and cell division. Alternatively spliced variants that encode different protein isoforms have been described but the full-length sequences of only two have been determined.","Variant counts

Summary
The correlation of anti-sperm antibodies with cases of unexplained infertility implicates a role for these antibodies in blocking fertilization. Improved diagnosis and treatment of immunologic infertility, as well as identification of proteins for targeted contraception, are dependent on the identification and characterization of relevant sperm antigens. The protein expressed by this gene is recognized by anti-sperm antibodies from an infertile man. This protein localizes to the tail of permeabilized human sperm and contains eight contiguous armadillo repeats, a motif known to mediate protein-protein interactions. Studies in mice suggest that this protein is involved in sperm flagellar motility and maintenance of the structural integrity of mature sperm.

Summary
This gene encodes a protein localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane and thought to be involved in the biogenesis of the cytochrome c oxidase complex. The protein is a member of the SURF1 family, which includes the related yeast protein SHY1 and rickettsial protein RP733. The gene is located in the surfeit gene cluster, a group of very tightly linked genes that do not share sequence similarity, where it shares a bidirectional promoter with SURF2 on the opposite strand. Defects in this gene are a cause of Leigh syndrome, a severe neurological disorder that is commonly associated with systemic cytochrome c oxidase deficiency.","Variant counts

Summary
The correlation of anti-sperm antibodies with cases of unexplained infertility implicates a role for these antibodies in blocking fertilization. Improved diagnosis and treatment of immunologic infertility, as well as identification of proteins for targeted contraception, are dependent on the identification and characterization of relevant sperm antigens. The protein expressed by this gene is recognized by anti-sperm antibodies from infertile males. Furthermore, antibodies generated against the recombinant protein block in vitro fertilization. This protein localizes to the acrosomal membrane of spermatids and mature spermatozoa where it is thought to play a role in acrosomal morphogenesis and in sperm-egg binding and fusion, respectively.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a highly sialylated glycoprotein that functions in antigen-specific activation of T cells, and is found on the surface of thymocytes, T lymphocytes, monocytes, granulocytes, and some B lymphocytes. It contains a mucin-like extracellular domain, a transmembrane region and a carboxy-terminal intracellular region. The extracellular domain has a high proportion of serine and threonine residues, allowing extensive O-glycosylation, and has one potential N-glycosylation site, while the carboxy-terminal region has potential phosphorylation sites that may mediate transduction of activation signals. Different glycoforms of this protein have been described. In stimulated immune cells, proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular domain occurs in some cell types, releasing a soluble extracellular fragment. Defects in expression of this gene are associated with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the Sp subfamily of Sp/XKLF transcription factors. Sp family proteins are sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins characterized by an amino-terminal trans-activation domain and three carboxy-terminal zinc finger motifs. This protein contains the least conserved DNA-binding domain within the Sp subfamily of proteins, and its DNA sequence specificity differs from the other Sp proteins. It localizes primarily within subnuclear foci associated with the nuclear matrix, and can activate or in some cases repress expression from different promoters.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene belongs to a family of Sp1 related genes that encode transcription factors that regulate transcription by binding to consensus GC- and GT-box regulatory elements in target genes. This protein contains a zinc finger DNA-binding domain and several transactivation domains, and has been reported to function as a bifunctional transcription factor that either stimulates or represses the transcription of numerous genes. Transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene, and one has been reported to initiate translation from a non-AUG (AUA) start codon. Additional isoforms, resulting from the use of alternate downstream translation initiation sites, have also been noted. A related pseudogene has been identified on chromosome 13.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene catalyzes the phosphorylation of sphingosine to form sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a lipid mediator with both intra- and extracellular functions. Intracellularly, S1P regulates proliferation and survival, and extracellularly, it is a ligand for cell surface G protein-coupled receptors. This protein, and its product S1P, play a key role in TNF-alpha signaling and the NF-kappa-B activation pathway important in inflammatory, antiapoptotic, and immune processes. Phosphorylation of this protein alters its catalytic activity and promotes its translocation to the plasma membrane. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the the SLC39A family of divalent metal transporters that mediates the cellular uptake of manganese, zinc, iron, and cadmium. The encoded protein contains eight transmembrane domains, a histidine-rich motif, and a metalloprotease motif, and is expressed on the plasma membrane and the endocytic vesicle membrane. It is an important transporter of nontransferrin-bound iron and a critical regulator of manganese homeostasis. Naturally occurring mutations in this gene are associated with neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation and early-onset parkinsonism-dystonia with hypermanganesemia.","Variant counts

Summary
DEAD box proteins, characterized by the conserved motif Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD), are putative RNA helicases. They are implicated in a number of cellular processes involving alteration of RNA secondary structure such as translation initiation, nuclear and mitochondrial splicing, and ribosome and spliceosome assembly. Based on their distribution patterns, some members of this family are believed to be involved in embryogenesis, spermatogenesis, and cellular growth and division. This gene encodes a DEAD box protein, which is a human homologue of yeast SKI2 and may be involved in antiviral activity by blocking translation of poly(A) deficient mRNAs. This gene is located in the class III region of the major histocompatibility complex.","Variant counts

Summary
This locus encodes a member of the SLIT-ROBO Rho GTPase activating protein family. This human-specific locus resulted from incomplete segmental duplication of the SLIT-ROBO Rho GTPase activating protein 2 locus. The encoded protein lacks the GTPase activating protein domain compared to proteins encoded by SLIT-ROBO Rho GTPase activating protein 2. The functionality of the protein encoded by this locus has been questioned, as several normal individuals with homozygous deletions for this locus have been identified, and the expression of this locus appears to be much lower than the similar SLIT-ROBO Rho GTPase activating protein 2C (SRGAP2C) locus. The SRGAP2C locus has been shown to encode a protein that functions antagonistically to SLIT-ROBO Rho GTPase activating protein 2 in cortical neuron development.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a hormone inducible transcriptional repressor. Repression of transcription by this gene product can occur through interactions with other repressors, by the recruitment of proteins involved in histone deacetylation, or through sequestration of transcriptional activators. The product of this gene contains a carboxy-terminal domain that permits binding to other corepressor proteins. This domain also permits interaction with members of the NuRD complex, a nucleosome remodeling protein complex that contains deacetylase activity. In addition, this repressor contains several RNA recognition motifs that confer binding to a steroid receptor RNA coactivator; this binding can modulate the activity of both liganded and nonliganded steroid receptors.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the SEC24 subfamily of the SEC23/SEC24 family, which is involved in vesicle trafficking. The encoded protein is thought to be a cargo-binding component of the COPII vesicle, and is thought to be involved in the transport of secretory proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. Mutations in this gene have been associated with neural tube defects, and are thought to be a result of a disruption in interactions with the protein encoded by the VANGL planar cell polarity protein 2 (VANGL2) gene. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that is instrumental in patterning the early embryo. It has been implicated as the key inductive signal in patterning of the ventral neural tube, the anterior-posterior limb axis, and the ventral somites. Of three human proteins showing sequence and functional similarity to the sonic hedgehog protein of Drosophila, this protein is the most similar. The protein is made as a precursor that is autocatalytically cleaved; the N-terminal portion is soluble and contains the signalling activity while the C-terminal portion is involved in precursor processing. More importantly, the C-terminal product covalently attaches a cholesterol moiety to the N-terminal product, restricting the N-terminal product to the cell surface and preventing it from freely diffusing throughout the developing embryo. Defects in this protein or in its signalling pathway are a cause of holoprosencephaly (HPE), a disorder in which the developing forebrain fails to correctly separate into right and left hemispheres. HPE is manifested by facial deformities. It is also thought that mutations in this gene or in its signalling pathway may be responsible for VACTERL syndrome, which is characterized by vertebral defects, anal atresia, tracheoesophageal fistula with esophageal atresia, radial and renal dysplasia, cardiac anomalies, and limb abnormalities. Additionally, mutations in a long range enhancer located approximately 1 megabase upstream of this gene disrupt limb patterning and can result in preaxial polydactyly.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes the mitochondrial seryl-tRNA synthethase precursor, a member of the class II tRNA synthetase family. The mature enzyme catalyzes the ligation of Serine to tRNA(Ser) and participates in the biosynthesis of selenocysteinyl-tRNA(sec) in mitochondria. The enzyme contains an N-terminal tRNA binding domain and a core catalytic domain. It functions in a homodimeric form, which is stabilized by tRNA binding. This gene is regulated by a bidirectional promoter that also controls the expression of mitochondrial ribosomal protein S12. Both genes are within the critical interval for the autosomal dominant deafness locus DFNA4 and might be linked to this disease. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified for this gene.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a secreted, homodimeric glycoprotein that is expressed in a wide variety of tissues and may have autocrine or paracrine functions. The gene contains a 5' UTR rich in CAG trinucleotide repeats. The encoded protein contains 11 conserved cysteine residues and is phosphorylated by protein kinase C exclusively on its serine residues. The protein may play a role in the regulation of renal and intestinal calcium and phosphate transport, cell metabolism, or cellular calcium/phosphate homeostasis. Overexpression of human stanniocalcin 1 in mice produces high serum phosphate levels, dwarfism, and increased metabolic rate. This gene has altered expression in hepatocellular, ovarian, and breast cancers.","Variant counts

Its C-terminus contains a cluster of histidine residues which may interact with metal ions. The protein may play a role in the regulation of renal and intestinal calcium and phosphate transport, cell metabolism, or cellular calcium/phosphate homeostasis. Constitutive overexpression of human stanniocalcin 2 in mice resulted in pre- and postnatal growth restriction, reduced bone and skeletal muscle growth, and organomegaly. Expression of this gene is induced by estrogen and altered in some breast cancers.","Variant counts

Summary
Proper cohesion of sister chromatids is a prerequisite for the correct segregation of chromosomes during cell division. The cohesin multiprotein complex is required for sister chromatid cohesion. This complex is composed partly of two structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) proteins, SMC3 and either SMC1B or the protein encoded by this gene. Most of the cohesin complexes dissociate from the chromosomes before mitosis, although those complexes at the kinetochore remain. Therefore, the encoded protein is thought to be an important part of functional kinetochores. In addition, this protein interacts with BRCA1 and is phosphorylated by ATM, indicating a potential role for this protein in DNA repair. This gene, which belongs to the SMC gene family, is located in an area of the X-chromosome that escapes X inactivation. Mutations in this gene result in Cornelia de Lange syndrome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLH-Zip) transcription factor that binds to the sterol regulatory element-1 (SRE1), which is a motif that is found in the promoter of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene and other genes involved in sterol biosynthesis. The encoded protein is synthesized as a precursor that is initially attached to the nuclear membrane and endoplasmic reticulum. Following cleavage, the mature protein translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription. This cleaveage is inhibited by sterols. This gene is located within the Smith-Magenis syndrome region on chromosome 17. Alternative promoter usage and splicing result in multiple transcript variants, including SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c, which correspond to RefSeq transcript variants 2 and 3, respectively.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene contains a STE20-like kinase domain, but lacks several residues that are critical for catalytic activity, so it is termed a 'pseudokinase'. The protein forms a heterotrimeric complex with serine/threonine kinase 11 (STK11, also known as LKB1) and the scaffolding protein calcium binding protein 39 (CAB39, also known as MO25). The protein activates STK11 leading to the phosphorylation of both proteins and excluding STK11 from the nucleus. The protein is necessary for STK11-induced G1 cell cycle arrest. A mutation in this gene has been shown to result in polyhydramnios, megalencephaly, and symptomatic epilepsy (PMSE) syndrome. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. Additional transcript variants have been described but their full-length nature is not known.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that belongs to the serine/threonine protein kinase STE20 subfamily. One of the active site residues in the protein kinase domain of this protein is altered, and it is thus a pseudokinase. This protein is a component of a complex involved in the activation of serine/threonine kinase 11, a master kinase that regulates cell polarity and energy-generating metabolism. This complex regulates the relocation of this kinase from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and it is essential for G1 cell cycle arrest mediated by this kinase. The protein encoded by this gene can also interact with the X chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein, and this interaction enhances the anti-apoptotic activity of this protein via the JNK1 signal transduction pathway. Two pseudogenes, located on chromosomes 1 and 7, have been found for this gene. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a cytoplasmic kinase that is structurally similar to the yeast Ste20p kinase, which acts upstream of the stress-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. The encoded protein can phosphorylate myelin basic protein and undergoes autophosphorylation. A caspase-cleaved fragment of the encoded protein has been shown to be capable of phosphorylating histone H2B. The particular phosphorylation catalyzed by this protein has been correlated with apoptosis, and it's possible that this protein induces the chromatin condensation observed in this process.","Variant counts

Summary
Two types of spliceosomes catalyze splicing of pre-mRNAs. The major U2-type spliceosome is found in all eukaryotes and removes U2-type introns, which represent more than 99% of pre-mRNA introns. The minor U12-type spliceosome is found in some eukaryotes and removes U12-type introns, which are rare and have distinct splice consensus signals. The U12-type spliceosome consists of several small nuclear RNAs and associated proteins. This gene encodes a 25K protein that is a component of the U12-type spliceosome.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a serine/arginine-rich (SR) protein. SR proteins play important roles in pre-mRNA splicing by facilitating the recognition and selection of splice sites. The encoded protein associates with the 25S U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP, a major component of the U2-type spiceosome. The expression of this gene may be altered in cells infected with the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) retrovirus. A pseudogene of this gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 5. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been observed for this gene.","Variant counts

The reversible posttranslational modification of proteins by the addition of small ubiquitin-like SUMO proteins (see SUMO1; MIM 601912) is required for many cellular processes. SUMO-specific proteases, such as SENP7, process SUMO precursors to generate a C-terminal diglycine motif required for the conjugation reaction. They also display isopeptidase activity for deconjugation of SUMO-conjugated substrates (Lima and Reverter, 2008 [PubMed 18799455]).","Variant counts

Summary
Ubiquitin-like molecules (UBLs), such as SUMO1 (UBL1; MIM 601912), are structurally related to ubiquitin (MIM 191339) and can be ligated to target proteins in a similar manner as ubiquitin. However, covalent attachment of UBLs does not result in degradation of the modified proteins. SUMO1 modification is implicated in the targeting of RANGAP1 (MIM 602362) to the nuclear pore complex, as well as in stabilization of I-kappa-B-alpha (NFKBIA; MIM 164008) from degradation by the 26S proteasome. Like ubiquitin, UBLs are synthesized as precursor proteins, with 1 or more amino acids following the C-terminal glycine-glycine residues of the mature UBL protein. Thus, the tail sequences of the UBL precursors need to be removed by UBL-specific proteases, such as SENP6, prior to their conjugation to target proteins (Kim et al., 2000 [PubMed 10799485]). SENPs also display isopeptidase activity for deconjugation of SUMO-conjugated substrates (Lima and Reverter, 2008 [PubMed 18799455]).","Variant counts

This gene encodes the pulmonary-associated surfactant protein B (SPB), an amphipathic surfactant protein essential for lung function and homeostasis after birth. Pulmonary surfactant is a surface-active lipoprotein complex composed of 90% lipids and 10% proteins which include plasma proteins and apolipoproteins SPA, SPB, SPC and SPD. The surfactant is secreted by the alveolar cells of the lung and maintains the stability of pulmonary tissue by reducing the surface tension of fluids that coat the lung. The SPB enhances the rate of spreading and increases the stability of surfactant monolayers in vitro. Multiple mutations in this gene have been identified, which cause pulmonary surfactant metabolism dysfunction type 1, also called pulmonary alveolar proteinosis due to surfactant protein B deficiency, and are associated with fatal respiratory distress in the neonatal period. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein have been identified.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes the pulmonary-associated surfactant protein C (SPC), an extremely hydrophobic surfactant protein essential for lung function and homeostasis after birth. Pulmonary surfactant is a surface-active lipoprotein complex composed of 90% lipids and 10% proteins which include plasma proteins and apolipoproteins SPA, SPB, SPC and SPD. The surfactant is secreted by the alveolar cells of the lung and maintains the stability of pulmonary tissue by reducing the surface tension of fluids that coat the lung. Multiple mutations in this gene have been identified, which cause pulmonary surfactant metabolism dysfunction type 2, also called pulmonary alveolar proteinosis due to surfactant protein C deficiency, and are associated with interstitial lung disease in older infants, children, and adults. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different protein isoforms have been identified.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the family of calcium-binding mitochondrial carriers, with a characteristic mitochondrial carrier domain at the C-terminus. These proteins are found in the inner membranes of mitochondria, and function as transport proteins. They shuttle metabolites, nucleotides and cofactors through the mitochondrial membrane and thereby connect and/or regulate cytoplasm and matrix functions. This protein may function as an ATP-Mg/Pi carrier that mediates the transport of Mg-ATP in exchange for phosphate, and likely responsible for the net uptake or efflux of adenine nucleotides into or from the mitochondria. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms with a common C-terminus but variable N-termini have been described for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
WW domain-containing proteins are found in all eukaryotes and play an important role in the regulation of a wide variety of cellular functions such as protein degradation, transcription, and RNA splicing. This gene encodes a protein with two WW domains, a SARAH domain, and a coiled-coil region and is ubiquitously expressed in adult tissues. This protein binds to MST1 (mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1) and promotes MST1-induced apoptosis. It has also been shown to bind to HAX1 (hematopoietic cell-specific protein 1 (HS1)-associated protein X-1) and to attenuate the anti-apoptotic effects of HAX1. Studies in human and mouse suggest this gene acts as a tumor suppressor.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene was initially identified as a molecule linking syndecan-mediated signaling to the cytoskeleton. The syntenin protein contains tandemly repeated PDZ domains that bind the cytoplasmic, C-terminal domains of a variety of transmembrane proteins. This protein may also affect cytoskeletal-membrane organization, cell adhesion, protein trafficking, and the activation of transcription factors. The protein is primarily localized to membrane-associated adherens junctions and focal adhesions but is also found at the endoplasmic reticulum and nucleus. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. Related pseudogenes have been identified on multiple chromosomes.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene has weak homology to several carbohydrate kinases, a class of proteins involved in the phosphorylation of sugars as they enter a cell, inhibiting return across the cell membrane. Sequence variation between this novel gene and known carbohydrate kinases suggests the possibility of a different substrate, cofactor or changes in kinetic properties distinguishing it from other carbohydrate kinases. The gene resides in a region commonly deleted in cystinosis patients, suggesting a role as a modifier for the cystinosis phenotype. The genomic region is also rich in Alu repetitive sequences, frequently involved in chromosomal rearrangements.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is part of a 500 kb inverted duplication on chromosome 5q13. This duplicated region contains at least four genes and repetitive elements which make it prone to rearrangements and deletions. The repetitiveness and complexity of the sequence have also caused difficulty in determining the organization of this genomic region. The duplication region includes both a telomeric and a centromeric copy of this gene. Deletions of this gene, the telomeric copy, often accompany deletions of the neighboring SMN1 gene in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) patients, and so it is thought that this gene may be a modifier of the SMA phenotype. The function of this protein is not known; however, it bears low-level homology with the RNA-binding domain of matrin-cyclophilin, a protein which colocalizes with small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and the SMN1 gene product. Alternatively spliced transcripts have been documented but it is unclear whether alternative splicing occurs for both the centromeric and telomeric copies of the gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Synaptic vesicle membrane docking and fusion is mediated by SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) located on the vesicle membrane (v-SNAREs) and the target membrane (t-SNAREs). The assembled v-SNARE/t-SNARE complex consists of a bundle of four helices, one of which is supplied by v-SNARE and the other three by t-SNARE. For t-SNAREs on the plasma membrane, the protein syntaxin supplies one helix and the protein encoded by this gene contributes the other two. Therefore, this gene product is a presynaptic plasma membrane protein involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release. Two alternative transcript variants encoding different protein isoforms have been described for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Specificity of vesicular transport is regulated, in part, by the interaction of a vesicle-associated membrane protein termed synaptobrevin/VAMP with a target compartment membrane protein termed syntaxin. These proteins, together with SNAP25 (synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa), form a complex which serves as a binding site for the general membrane fusion machinery. Synaptobrevin/VAMP and syntaxin are believed to be involved in vesicular transport in most, if not all cells, while SNAP25 is present almost exclusively in the brain, suggesting that a ubiquitously expressed homolog of SNAP25 exists to facilitate transport vesicle/target membrane fusion in other tissues. The protein encoded by this gene is structurally and functionally similar to SNAP25 and binds tightly to multiple syntaxins and synaptobrevins/VAMPs. It is an essential component of the high affinity receptor for the general membrane fusion machinery and is an important regulator of transport vesicle docking and fusion. Two alternative transcript variants encoding different protein isoforms have been described for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene, a member of the SNAP25 gene family, encodes a protein involved in multiple membrane trafficking steps. Two other members of this gene family, SNAP23 and SNAP25, encode proteins that bind a syntaxin protein and mediate synaptic vesicle membrane docking and fusion to the plasma membrane. The protein encoded by this gene binds tightly to multiple syntaxins and is localized to intracellular membrane structures rather than to the plasma membrane. While the protein is mostly membrane-bound, a significant fraction of it is found free in the cytoplasm. Use of multiple polyadenylation sites has been noted for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Somatostatins are peptide hormones that regulate diverse cellular functions such as neurotransmission, cell proliferation, and endocrine signaling as well as inhibiting the release of many hormones and other secretory proteins. Somatostatin has two active forms of 14 and 28 amino acids. The biological effects of somatostatins are mediated by a family of G-protein coupled somatostatin receptors that are expressed in a tissue-specific manner. The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the superfamily of somatostatin receptors having seven transmembrane segments. Somatostatin receptors form homodimers and heterodimers with other members of the superfamily as well as with other G-protein coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases. This somatostatin receptor has greater affinity for somatostatin-14 than -28.","Variant counts

Summary
Somatostatin and its related peptide cortistatin exert multiple biological actions on normal and tumoral tissue targets by interacting with somatostatin receptors (SSTRs). The protein encoded by this gene is one of the SSTRs, which is a multi-pass membrane protein and belongs to the G-protein coupled receptor 1 family. The activity of this receptor is mediated by G proteins which inhibit adenylyl cyclase, and different regions of this receptor molecule are required for the activation of different signaling pathways. A mutation in this gene results in somatostatin analog resistance. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been identified in this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a zinc efflux transporter involved in the accumulation of zinc in intracellular vesicles. This gene is expressed at a high level only in the pancreas, particularly in islets of Langerhans. The encoded protein colocalizes with insulin in the secretory pathway granules of the insulin-secreting INS-1 cells. Allelic variants of this gene exist that confer susceptibility to diabetes mellitus, noninsulin-dependent (NIDDM). Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the SLC30A/ZnT family of zinc transporter proteins. ZnT proteins mediate both cellular zinc efflux and zinc sequestration into membrane-bound organelles. The encoded protein plays a role in the early secretory pathway as a heterodimer with zinc transporter 6, and may also regulate zinc sequestration into secretory granules of pancreatic beta cells. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene, and a pseudogene of this gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 19.","Variant counts

Summary
Zinc is the second most abundant trace metal in the human body. It is an essential element, serving both a structural role, as in the formation of zinc fingers in DNA-binding proteins, and a catalytic role in metalloenzymes, such as pancreatic carboxypeptidases (e.g., MIM 114852), alkaline phosphatases (e.g., MIM 171760), various dehydrogenases, and superoxide dismutases (e.g., MIM 147450). SLC30A4, or ZNT4, belongs to the ZNT family of zinc transporters. ZNTs are involved in transporting zinc out of the cytoplasm and have similar structures, consisting of 6 transmembrane domains and a histidine-rich cytoplasmic loop (Huang and Gitschier, 1997 [PubMed 9354792]).","Variant counts

Staufen is a member of the family of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-binding proteins involved in the transport and/or localization of mRNAs to different subcellular compartments and/or organelles. These proteins are characterized by the presence of multiple dsRNA-binding domains which are required to bind RNAs having double-stranded secondary structures. The human homologue of staufen encoded by STAU, in addition contains a microtubule- binding domain similar to that of microtubule-associated protein 1B, and binds tubulin. The STAU gene product has been shown to be present in the cytoplasm in association with the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), implicating this protein in the transport of mRNA via the microtubule network to the RER, the site of translation.","Variant counts

These proteins are characterized by the presence of multiple dsRNA-binding domains which are required to bind RNAs having double-stranded secondary structures. Staufen homolog 2 shares 48.5% and 59.9% similarity with drosophila and human staufen, respectively. The exact function of Staufen homolog 2 is not known, but since it contains 3 copies of conserved dsRNA binding domain, it could be involved in double-stranded RNA binding events. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Sulfotransferase enzymes catalyze the sulfate conjugation of many hormones, neurotransmitters, drugs, and xenobiotic compounds. These cytosolic enzymes are different in their tissue distributions and substrate specificities. The gene structure (number and length of exons) is similar among family members. This gene encodes a phenol sulfotransferase with thermolabile enzyme activity. Four sulfotransferase genes are located on the p arm of chromosome 16, this gene and SULT1A3 arose from a segmental duplication. Read-through transcription exists between this gene and the upstream SLX1B (SLX1 structure-specific endonuclease subunit homolog B) gene that encodes a protein containing GIY-YIG domains.","Variant counts

Sulfotransferase enzymes catalyze the sulfate conjugation of many hormones, neurotransmitters, drugs, and xenobiotic compounds. These cytosolic enzymes are different in their tissue distributions and substrate specificities. The gene structure (number and length of exons) is similar among family members. This gene encodes a phenol sulfotransferase with thermolabile enzyme activity. Four sulfotransferase genes are located on the p arm of chromosome 16; this gene and SULT1A4 arose from a segmental duplication. This gene is the most centromeric of the four sulfotransferase genes. Read-through transcription exists between this gene and the upstream SLX1A (SLX1 structure-specific endonuclease subunit homolog A) gene that encodes a protein containing GIY-YIG domains.","Variant counts

Summary
Lactic acid and pyruvate transport across plasma membranes is catalyzed by members of the proton-linked monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) family, which has been designated solute carrier family-16. Each MCT appears to have slightly different substrate and inhibitor specificities and transport kinetics, which are related to the metabolic requirements of the tissues in which it is found. The MCTs, which include MCT1 (SLC16A1; MIM 600682) and MCT2 (SLC16A7; MIM 603654), are characterized by 12 predicted transmembrane domains (Price et al., 1998 [PubMed 9425115]).","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes an integral membrane protein that functions as a transporter of thyroid hormone. The encoded protein facilitates the cellular importation of thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3), reverse triiodothyronine (rT3) and diidothyronine (T2). This gene is expressed in many tissues and likely plays an important role in the development of the central nervous system. Loss of function mutations in this gene are associated with psychomotor retardation in males while females exhibit no neurological defects and more moderate thyroid-deficient phenotypes. This gene is subject to X-chromosome inactivation. Mutations in this gene are the cause of Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome.","Variant counts

Histone mRNAs do not contain introns or polyadenylation signals, and are processed by endonucleolytic cleavage. The stem-loop structure is essential for efficient processing but this structure also controls the transport, translation and stability of histone mRNAs. Expression of the protein is regulated during the cell cycle, increasing more than 10-fold during the latter part of G1.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a multifunctional protein that binds ubiquitin and regulates activation of the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kB) signaling pathway. The protein functions as a scaffolding/adaptor protein in concert with TNF receptor-associated factor 6 to mediate activation of NF-kB in response to upstream signals. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding either the same or different isoforms have been identified for this gene. Mutations in this gene result in sporadic and familial Paget disease of bone.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is an RNA-binding nuclear protein that is a tumor-rejection antigen. This antigen possesses tumor epitopes capable of inducing HLA-A24-restricted and tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in cancer patients and may be useful for specific immunotherapy. This gene product is found to be an important cellular factor for HIV-1 gene expression and viral replication. It also associates transiently with U6 and U4/U6 snRNPs during the recycling phase of the spliceosome cycle. This encoded protein is thought to be involved in the regulation of mRNA splicing.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes two proteins, the SART1(800) protein expressed in the nucleus of the majority of proliferating cells, and the SART1(259) protein expressed in the cytosol of epithelial cancers. The SART1(259) protein is translated by the mechanism of -1 frameshifting during posttranscriptional regulation; its full-length sequence is not published yet. The two encoded proteins are thought to be involved in the regulation of proliferation. Both proteins have tumor-rejection antigens. The SART1(259) protein possesses tumor epitopes capable of inducing HLA-A2402-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes in cancer patients. This SART1(259) antigen may be useful in specific immunotherapy for cancer patients and may serve as a paradigmatic tool for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with atopy. The SART1(259) protein is found to be essential for the recruitment of the tri-snRNP to the pre-spliceosome in the spliceosome assembly pathway.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a type III glycoprotein that is located primarily in limiting membranes of lysosomes and endosomes. Earlier studies in mice and rat suggested that this protein may participate in membrane transportation and the reorganization of endosomal/lysosomal compartment. The protein deficiency in mice was reported to impair cell membrane transport processes and cause pelvic junction obstruction, deafness, and peripheral neuropathy. Further studies in human showed that this protein is a ubiquitously expressed protein and that it is involved in the pathogenesis of HFMD (hand, foot, and mouth disease) caused by enterovirus-71 and possibly by coxsackievirus A16. Mutations in this gene caused an autosomal recessive progressive myoclonic epilepsy-4 (EPM4), also known as action myoclonus-renal failure syndrome (AMRF). Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein belonging to the sprouty family. The encoded protein contains a carboxyl-terminal cysteine-rich domain essential for the inhibitory activity on receptor tyrosine kinase signaling proteins and is required for growth factor stimulated translocation of the protein to membrane ruffles. In primary dermal endothelial cells this gene is transiently upregulated in response to fibroblast growth factor two. This protein is indirectly involved in the non-cell autonomous inhibitory effect on fibroblast growth factor two signaling. The protein interacts with Cas-Br-M (murine) ectropic retroviral transforming sequence, and can function as a bimodal regulator of epidermal growth factor receptor/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. This protein may play a role in alveoli branching during lung development as shown by a similar mouse protein.","Variant counts

Summary
Members of the SOX family of transcription factors are characterized by the presence of a DNA-binding high mobility group (HMG) domain, homologous to the HMG box of sex-determining region Y (SRY). Forming a subgroup of the HMG domain superfamily, SOX proteins have been implicated in cell fate decisions in a diverse range of developmental processes. SOX transcription factors have diverse tissue-specific expression patterns during early development and have been proposed to act as target-specific transcription factors and/or as chromatin structure regulatory elements. The protein encoded by this gene was identified as a SOX family member based on conserved domains, and its expression in various tissues suggests a role in both differentiation and maintenance of several cell types.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that contains multiple simple repeats. The encoded protein binds RNA and promotes pre-mRNA splicing, particularly of transcripts with poor splice sites. The protein also recognizes a specific DNA sequence found in the human hepatitis B virus (HBV) and represses HBV core promoter activity. There is a pseudogene for this gene on chromosome 1. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes an evolutionarily-conserved protein containing an N-terminal chromodomain and a C-terminal SET domain. The encoded protein is a histone methyltransferase that trimethylates lysine 9 of histone H3, which results in transcriptional gene silencing. Loss of function of this gene disrupts heterochromatin formation and may cause chromosome instability. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) catalyzes the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to molecular oxygen, which helps to maintain the proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane that is necessary for aerobic ATP production. Human COX is a multimeric protein complex that requires several assembly factors; this gene encodes one of the COX assembly factors. The encoded protein is a metallochaperone that is involved in the biogenesis of cytochrome c oxidase subunit II. Mutations in this gene are associated with fatal infantile encephalocardiomyopathy and myopia 6.","Variant counts

Summary
Hyaluronidase degrades hyaluronic acid, a major structural proteoglycan found in extracellular matrices and basement membranes. Six members of the hyaluronidase family are clustered into two tightly linked groups on chromosome 3p21.3 and 7q31.3. This gene was previously referred to as HYAL1 and HYA1 and has since been assigned the official symbol SPAM1; another family member on chromosome 3p21.3 has been assigned HYAL1. This gene encodes a GPI-anchored enzyme located on the human sperm surface and inner acrosomal membrane. This multifunctional protein is a hyaluronidase that enables sperm to penetrate through the hyaluronic acid-rich cumulus cell layer surrounding the oocyte, a receptor that plays a role in hyaluronic acid induced cell signaling, and a receptor that is involved in sperm-zona pellucida adhesion. Abnormal expression of this gene in tumors has implicated this protein in degradation of basement membranes leading to tumor invasion and metastasis. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the SWI/SNF family of proteins. Members of this family have helicase and ATPase activities and are thought to regulate transcription of certain genes by altering the chromatin structure around those genes. The encoded protein shows sequence similarity to the E. coli RNA polymerase-binding protein HepA. Mutations in this gene are a cause of Schimke immunoosseous dysplasia (SIOD), an autosomal recessive disorder with the diagnostic features of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, renal dysfunction, and T-cell immunodeficiency.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a transmembrane proton-coupled folate transporter protein that facilitates the movement of folate and antifolate substrates across cell membranes, optimally in acidic pH environments. This protein is also expressed in the brain and choroid plexus where it transports folates into the central nervous system. This protein further functions as a heme transporter in duodenal enterocytes, and potentially in other tissues like liver and kidney. Its localization to the apical membrane or cytoplasm of intestinal cells is modulated by dietary iron levels. Mutations in this gene are associated with autosomal recessive hereditary folate malabsorption disease. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene.","Variant counts

SRY-related HMG-box (SOX) genes encode a family of DNA-binding proteins containing a 79-amino acid HMG (high mobility group) domain that shares at least 50% sequence identity with the DNA-binding HMG box of the SRY protein (MIM 480000). SOX proteins are divided into 6 subgroups based on sequence similarity within and outside of the HMG domain. For additional background information on SOX genes, see SOX1 (MIM 602148).","Variant counts

Summary
Semaphorins are a large family, including both secreted and membrane associated proteins, many of which have been implicated as inhibitors or chemorepellents in axon pathfinding, fasciculation and branching, and target selection. All semaphorins possess a semaphorin (Sema) domain and a PSI domain (found in plexins, semaphorins and integrins) in the N-terminal extracellular portion. Additional sequence motifs C-terminal to the semaphorin domain allow classification into distinct subfamilies. Results demonstrate that transmembrane semaphorins, like the secreted ones, can act as repulsive axon guidance cues. This gene encodes a class 6 vertebrate transmembrane semaphorin that demonstrates alternative splicing. Several transcript variants have been identified and expression of the distinct encoded isoforms is thought to be regulated in a tissue- and development-dependent manner.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the SLC26A/SulP transporter family. The protein functions as a molecular motor in motile outer hair cells (OHCs) of the cochlea, inducing changes in cell length that act to amplify sound levels. The transmembrane protein is an incomplete anion transporter, and does not allow anions to cross the cell membrane but instead undergoes a conformational change in response to changes in intracellular Cl- levels that results in a change in cell length. The protein functions at microsecond rates, which is several orders of magnitude faster than conventional molecular motor proteins. Mutations in this gene are potential candidates for causing neurosensory deafness. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is part of a 500 kb inverted duplication on chromosome 5q13. This duplicated region contains at least four genes and repetitive elements which make it prone to rearrangements and deletions. The repetitiveness and complexity of the sequence have also caused difficulty in determining the organization of this genomic region. The telomeric and centromeric copies of this gene are nearly identical and encode the same protein. While mutations in the telomeric copy are associated with spinal muscular atrophy, mutations in this gene, the centromeric copy, do not lead to disease. This gene may be a modifier of disease caused by mutation in the telomeric copy. The critical sequence difference between the two genes is a single nucleotide in exon 7, which is thought to be an exon splice enhancer. Note that the nine exons of both the telomeric and centromeric copies are designated historically as exon 1, 2a, 2b, and 3-8. It is thought that gene conversion events may involve the two genes, leading to varying copy numbers of each gene. The full length protein encoded by this gene localizes to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Within the nucleus, the protein localizes to subnuclear bodies called gems which are found near coiled bodies containing high concentrations of small ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). This protein forms heteromeric complexes with proteins such as SIP1 and GEMIN4, and also interacts with several proteins known to be involved in the biogenesis of snRNPs, such as hnRNP U protein and the small nucleolar RNA binding protein. Four transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been described.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a sodium ion- and chloride ion-dependent high-affinity transporter that mediates choline uptake for acetylcholine synthesis in cholinergic neurons. The protein transports choline from the extracellular space into presynaptic terminals for synthesis into acetylcholine. Increased choline uptake results from increased density of this protein in synaptosomal plasma membranes in response to depolarization of cholinergic terminals. Dysfunction of cholinergic signaling has been implicated in various disorders including depression, attention-deficit disorder, and schizophrenia. An allelic variant of this gene is associated with autosomal dominant distal hereditary motor neuronopathy type VIIA. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

SLC5A8 has been shown to transport iodide by a passive mechanism (Rodriguez et al., 2002 [PubMed 12107270]) and monocarboxylates and short-chain fatty acids by a sodium-coupled mechanism (Gopal et al., 2004 [PubMed 15322102]). In kidney, SLC5A8 functions as a high-affinity sodium-coupled lactate transporter involved in reabsorption of lactate and maintenance of blood lactate levels (Thangaraju et al., 2006 [PubMed 16873376]).","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a dopamine transporter which is a member of the sodium- and chloride-dependent neurotransmitter transporter family. The 3' UTR of this gene contains a 40 bp tandem repeat, referred to as a variable number tandem repeat or VNTR, which can be present in 3 to 11 copies. Variation in the number of repeats is associated with idiopathic epilepsy, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, dependence on alcohol and cocaine, susceptibility to Parkinson disease and protection against nicotine dependence.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes an integral membrane protein that transports the neurotransmitter serotonin from synaptic spaces into presynaptic neurons. The encoded protein terminates the action of serotonin and recycles it in a sodium-dependent manner. This protein is a target of psychomotor stimulants, such as amphetamines and cocaine, and is a member of the sodium:neurotransmitter symporter family. A repeat length polymorphism in the promoter of this gene has been shown to affect the rate of serotonin uptake. There have been conflicting results in the literature about the possible effect, if any, that this polymorphism may play in behavior and depression.","Variant counts

Similar to STAM, this protein acts downstream of JAK kinases, and is phosphorylated in response to cytokine stimulation. This protein and STAM thus are thought to exhibit compensatory effects on the signaling pathway downstream of JAK kinases upon cytokine stimulation.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is an epithelial-derived, integral membrane serine protease. This protease forms a complex with the Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor, HAI-1, and is found to be activated by sphingosine 1-phosphate. This protease has been shown to cleave and activate hepatocyte growth factor/scattering factor, and urokinase plasminogen activator, which suggest the function of this protease as an epithelial membrane activator for other proteases and latent growth factors. The expression of this protease has been associated with breast, colon, prostate, and ovarian tumors, which implicates its role in cancer invasion, and metastasis.","Variant counts

Summary
The product of this gene belongs to the family of highly homologous synovial sarcoma X (SSX) breakpoint proteins. These proteins may function as transcriptional repressors. They are also capable of eliciting spontaneously humoral and cellular immune responses in cancer patients, and are potentially useful targets in cancer vaccine-based immunotherapy. SSX1, SSX2 and SSX4 genes have been involved in the t(X;18) translocation characteristically found in all synovial sarcomas. This translocation results in the fusion of the synovial sarcoma translocation gene on chromosome 18 to one of the SSX genes on chromosome X. Chromosome Xp11 contains a segmental duplication resulting in two identical copies of synovial sarcoma, X breakpoint 4, SSX4 and SSX4B, in tail-to-tail orientation. This gene, SSX4B, represents the more centromeric copy. Two transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been identified for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS) is a mitochondrial matrix enzyme that acts as a heterodimer, being composed of an invariant alpha subunit and a substrate-specific beta subunit. The protein encoded by this gene is an ATP-specific SCS beta subunit that dimerizes with the SCS alpha subunit to form SCS-A, an essential component of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. SCS-A hydrolyzes ATP to convert succinate to succinyl-CoA. Defects in this gene are a cause of myopathic mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome. A pseudogene of this gene has been found on chromosome 6.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a glycoprotein that functions as a high affinity counter-receptor for the cell adhesion molecules P-, E- and L- selectin expressed on myeloid cells and stimulated T lymphocytes. As such, this protein plays a critical role in leukocyte trafficking during inflammation by tethering of leukocytes to activated platelets or endothelia expressing selectins. This protein requires two post-translational modifications, tyrosine sulfation and the addition of the sialyl Lewis x tetrasaccharide (sLex) to its O-linked glycans, for its high-affinity binding activity. Aberrant expression of this gene and polymorphisms in this gene are associated with defects in the innate and adaptive immune response. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
Temporally regulated transcription and translation of several testis-specific genes is required to initiate the series of molecular and morphological changes in the male germ cell lineage necessary for the formation of mature spermatozoa. This gene is a member of the SPANX family of cancer/testis-associated genes, which are located in a cluster on chromosome X. The SPANX genes encode differentially expressed testis-specific proteins that localize to various subcellular compartments. This particular family member contains an additional 18 nucleotides in its coding region compared to the other family members in the same gene cluster. This family member is also subject to gene copy number variation. Although the protein encoded by this gene contains consensus nuclear localization signals, the major site for subcellular localization of expressed protein is in the cytoplasmic droplets of ejaculated spermatozoa. This protein provides a biochemical marker for studying the unique structures in spermatazoa, while attempting to further define its role in spermatogenesis.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a system B(0) transmembrane protein that actively transports most neutral amino acids across the apical membrane of epithelial cells. Mutations in this gene may result in Hartnup disorder, an inherited disease with symptoms such as pellagra, cerebellar ataxia, and psychosis. The expression and function of B0AT1 (SLC6A19) in intestinal cells depends on the presence of the accessory protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which, among other functions, acts as a chaperone for membrane trafficking of B0AT1. The ACE2 is also the cellular receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and for SARS-CoV-2 that is causing the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic","Variant counts

This gene encodes an integral membrane protein, which is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, and functions as a phosphoinositide phosphatase that hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, and phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate. Deletion of this gene in mouse results in preimplantation lethality. Other studies suggest that this gene is also involved in the organization of golgi membranes and mitotic spindles. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. A C-terminally extended isoform is also predicted to be produced by the use of an alternative in-frame, downstream translation termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a ubiquitous nuclear protein that stimulates both cell proliferation and differentiation. It is a member of the MADS (MCM1, Agamous, Deficiens, and SRF) box superfamily of transcription factors. This protein binds to the serum response element (SRE) in the promoter region of target genes. This protein regulates the activity of many immediate-early genes, for example c-fos, and thereby participates in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, cell growth, and cell differentiation. This gene is the downstream target of many pathways; for example, the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (MAPK) that acts through the ternary complex factors (TCFs). Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes subunit 3 of the splicing factor 3b protein complex. Splicing factor 3b, together with splicing factor 3a and a 12S RNA unit, forms the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins complex (U2 snRNP). The splicing factor 3b/3a complex binds pre-mRNA upstream of the intron's branch site in a sequence independent manner and may anchor the U2 snRNP to the pre-mRNA. Splicing factor 3b is also a component of the minor U12-type spliceosome. Subunit 3 has also been identified as a component of the STAGA (SPT3-TAF(II)31-GCN5L acetylase) transcription coactivator-HAT (histone acetyltransferase) complex, and the TFTC (TATA-binding-protein-free TAF(II)-containing complex). These complexes may function in chromatin modification, transcription, splicing, and DNA repair.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a liver-specific member of the organic anion transporter family. The encoded protein is a transmembrane receptor that mediates the sodium-independent uptake of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds and plays a critical role in bile acid and bilirubin transport. Mutations in this gene are a cause of Rotor type hyperbilirubinemia. Alternative splicing of this gene and the use of alternative promoters results in transcript variants encoding different isoforms that differ in their tissue specificity.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a central pair protein present in the axonemes of cells with a '9 + 2' organization of microtubules. The encoded protein is required for the proper function of the axoneme. Mutations in the orthologous gene in mice lead to primary ciliary dyskinesia characterized by immotile nasal and tracheal cilia, reduced clearance of nasal mucus, profound respiratory distress, hydrocephalus, and neonatal lethality within twelve hours of birth due to impaired airway mucociliary clearance. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in this gene are associated with human height and targeted mutations lead to skeletal malformations affecting the limbs in mice, suggesting a role for this gene in skeletal development.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes three main isoforms that differ in activities and subcellular location. While all three are adapter proteins in signal transduction pathways, the longest (p66Shc) may be involved in regulating life span and the effects of reactive oxygen species. The other two isoforms, p52Shc and p46Shc, link activated receptor tyrosine kinases to the Ras pathway by recruitment of the GRB2/SOS complex. p66Shc is not involved in Ras activation. Unlike the other two isoforms, p46Shc is targeted to the mitochondrial matrix. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is located within the Prader-Willi Syndrome critical region on chromosome 15 and is imprinted and expressed from the paternal allele. It encodes a component of the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex, which functions in pre-mRNA processing and may contribute to tissue-specific alternative splicing. Alternative promoter use and alternative splicing result in a multitude of transcript variants encoding the same protein. Transcript variants that initiate at the CpG island-associated imprinting center may be bicistronic and also encode the SNRPN upstream reading frame protein (SNURF) from an upstream open reading frame. In addition, long spliced transcripts for small nucleolar RNA host gene 14 (SNHG14) may originate from the promoters at this locus and share exons with this gene. Alterations in this region are associated with parental imprint switch failure, which may cause Angelman syndrome or Prader-Willi syndrome.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene belongs to a small family of sodium-coupled bicarbonate transporters (NCBTs) that regulate the intracellular pH of neurons, the secretion of bicarbonate ions across the choroid plexus, and the pH of the brain extracellular fluid. The protein encoded by this gene was initially identified as a sodium-driven chloride bicarbonate exchanger (NCBE) though there is now evidence that its sodium/bicarbonate cotransport activity is independent of any chloride ion countertransport under physiological conditions. This gene is now classified as a member A10 of the SLC4 family of transmembrane solute carriers. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a mitochondrial protein that is a member of the solute carrier family. Although this protein was initially thought to be the mitochondrial deoxynucleotide carrier involved in the uptake of deoxynucleotides into the matrix of the mitochondria, further studies have demonstrated that this protein instead functions as the mitochondrial thiamine pyrophosphate carrier, which transports thiamine pyrophosphates into mitochondria. Mutations in this gene cause microcephaly, Amish type, a metabolic disease that results in severe congenital microcephaly, severe 2-ketoglutaric aciduria, and death within the first year. Multiple alternatively spliced variants, encoding the same protein, have been identified for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCP) are members of the larger family of mitochondrial anion carrier proteins (MACP). Uncoupling proteins separate oxidative phosphorylation from ATP synthesis with energy dissipated as heat, also referred to as the mitochondrial proton leak. Uncoupling proteins facilitate the transfer of anions from the inner to the outer mitochondrial membrane and the return transfer of protons from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane. They also reduce the mitochondrial membrane potential in mammalian cells. This gene is widely expressed in many tissues with the greatest abundance in brain and testis. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. A pseudogene of this gene has been defined on chromosome 4.","Variant counts

Summary
The nuclear body is a multiprotein complex that may have a role in the regulation of gene transcription. This gene is a member of the SP100/SP140 family of nuclear body proteins and encodes a leukocyte-specific nuclear body component. The protein can function as an activator of gene transcription and may serve as a nuclear hormone receptor coactivator. In addition, it has been suggested that the protein may play a role in ribosome biogenesis and in the induction of myeloid cell differentiation. Alternative splicing has been observed for this gene and three transcript variants, encoding distinct isoforms, have been identified.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the SWI/SNF family of proteins and is highly similar to the brahma protein of Drosophila. Members of this family have helicase and ATPase activities and are thought to regulate transcription of certain genes by altering the chromatin structure around those genes. The encoded protein is part of the large ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex SNF/SWI, which is required for transcriptional activation of genes normally repressed by chromatin. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene, which contains a trinucleotide repeat (CAG) length polymorphism.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that is a member of the SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) protein family. It functions in a manner similar to ubiquitin in that it is bound to target proteins as part of a post-translational modification system. However, unlike ubiquitin which targets proteins for degradation, this protein is involved in a variety of cellular processes, such as nuclear transport, transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, and protein stability. It is not active until the last four amino acids of the carboxy-terminus have been cleaved off. Several pseudogenes have been reported for this gene. Alternate transcriptional splice variants encoding different isoforms have been characterized.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that contains a coiled-coil motif and C-terminal forkhead-associated (FHA) domain. The encoded protein functions as a transcriptional coactivator that increases c-Myc activity and inhibits transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kB) signaling. The encoded protein also regulates the stability of cyclin D1 mRNA, and may play a role in cell proliferation and cancer progression. Mutations in this gene are a cause of psychomotor retardation, epilepsy, and craniofacial dysmorphism (PMRED).","Variant counts

Summary
This gene represents a homolog of the Drosophila single-minded (sim) gene, which encodes a transcription factor that is a master regulator of neurogenesis. The encoded protein is ubiquitinated by RING-IBR-RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligases, including the parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase. This gene maps within the so-called Down syndrome chromosomal region, and is thus thought to contribute to some specific Down syndrome phenotypes. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
Syntaxin 1 is a component of the 7S and 20S SNARE complexes which are involved in docking and fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic plasma membrane. This gene encodes a syntaxin 1 binding protein. In rat, a similar protein dissociates syntaxin 1 from the Munc18/n-Sec1/rbSec1 complex to form a 10S complex, an intermediate which can be converted to the 7S SNARE complex. Thus this protein is thought to be involved in neurotransmitter release by stimulating SNARE complex formation. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a cytoplasmic protein implicated in regulation of the mitotic spindle checkpoint, a regulatory pathway that monitors chromosome segregation during cell division to ensure the proper distribution of chromosomes to daughter cells. The protein is phosphorylated in mitosis and in response to activation of the spindle checkpoint, and disappears when cells transition to G1 phase. It interacts with a mitotic regulator, and its expression is required to efficiently activate the spindle checkpoint. It is proposed to regulate Cdc2 kinase activity during spindle checkpoint arrest. Chromosomal deletions that fuse this gene and the adjacent locus commonly occur in T cell leukemias, and are thought to arise through illegitimate V-(D)-J recombination events. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene may play a role in DNA repair during replication of damaged DNA. This protein recruits valosin containing protein (p97) to stalled DNA replication forks where it may prevent excessive translesional DNA synthesis and limit the number of DNA-damage induced mutations. It may also be involved in replication-related G2/M-checkpoint regulation. Deficiency of a similar protein in mouse causes chromosomal instability and progeroid phenotypes. Mutations in this gene have been associated with Ruijs-Aalfs syndrome (RJALS). Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been identified.","Variant counts

Summary
Alpha-synuclein is a member of the synuclein family, which also includes beta- and gamma-synuclein. Synucleins are abundantly expressed in the brain and alpha- and beta-synuclein inhibit phospholipase D2 selectively. SNCA may serve to integrate presynaptic signaling and membrane trafficking. Defects in SNCA have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease. SNCA peptides are a major component of amyloid plaques in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Alternatively spliced transcripts encoding different isoforms have been identified for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a type I transmembrane protein, belonging to the CD2 subfamily of the immunoglobulin superfamily. This encoded protein is expressed on Natural killer (NK), T, and B lymphocytes. It undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation and associates with the Src homology 2 domain-containing protein (SH2D1A) as well as with SH2 domain-containing phosphatases (SHPs). It functions as a coreceptor in the process of NK cell activation. It can also mediate inhibitory signals in NK cells from X-linked lymphoproliferative patients. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the semaphorin family and encodes a protein with an Ig-like C2-type (immunoglobulin-like) domain, a PSI domain and a Sema domain. This secreted protein can function as either a chemorepulsive agent, inhibiting axonal outgrowth, or as a chemoattractive agent, stimulating the growth of apical dendrites. In both cases, the protein is vital for normal neuronal pattern development. Increased expression of this protein is associated with schizophrenia and is seen in a variety of human tumor cell lines. Also, aberrant release of this protein is associated with the progression of Alzheimer's disease.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a secreted glycoprotein that belongs to the semaphorin class 3 family of neuronal guidance cues. The encoded protein contains an N-terminal sema domain, integrin and immunoglobulin-like domains, and a C-terminal basic domain. Homodimerization and proteolytic cleavage of the C-terminal propeptide are necessary for the function of the encoded protein. It binds a neuropilin co-receptor before forming a heterotrimeric complex with an associated plexin. An increase in the expression of this gene correlates with an increase in cancer cell invasion and adhesion. Naturally occurring mutations in this gene are associated with Hirschsprung disease.","Variant counts

Summary
Semaphorins are a large family of conserved secreted and membrane associated proteins which possess a semaphorin (Sema) domain and a PSI domain (found in plexins, semaphorins and integrins) in the N-terminal extracellular portion. Based on sequence and structural similarities, semaphorins are put into eight classes: invertebrates contain classes 1 and 2, viruses have class V, and vertebrates contain classes 3-7. Semaphorins serve as axon guidance ligands via multimeric receptor complexes, some (if not all) containing plexin proteins. This gene encodes a class 4 semaphorin. This gene encodes a class 3 semaphorin. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
K-Cl cotransporters are proteins that lower intracellular chloride concentrations below the electrochemical equilibrium potential. The protein encoded by this gene is an integral membrane K-Cl cotransporter that can function in either a net efflux or influx pathway, depending on the chemical concentration gradients of potassium and chloride. The encoded protein can act as a homomultimer, or as a heteromultimer with other K-Cl cotransporters, to maintain chloride homeostasis in neurons. Alternative splicing results in two transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts
The variants found in rare patients tested by 3billion are classified and counted according to ACMG guidelines. The variants with over 5% variant frequency in population genome databases ( gnomAD, dbSNP, etc) are excluded.

Summary
This gene encodes a kidney-specific sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter that is expressed on the luminal membrane of renal epithelial cells of the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop and the macula densa. It plays a key role in concentrating urine and accounts for most of the NaCl resorption. It is sensitive to such diuretics as furosemide and bumetanide. Some Bartter-like syndromes result from defects in this gene. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms. Additional splice variants have been described but their biological validity in humans has not been experimentally proven.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a renal thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride cotransporter that is important for electrolyte homeostasis. This cotransporter mediates sodium and chloride reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule. Mutations in this gene cause Gitelman syndrome, a disease similar to Bartter's syndrome, that is characterized by hypokalemic alkalosis combined with hypomagnesemia, low urinary calcium, and increased renin activity associated with normal blood pressure. This cotransporter is the target for thiazide diuretics that are used for treating high blood pressure. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is expressed in B lymphocytes and contains pleckstrin homology and src homology 2 (SH2) domains. In Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines, it is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to B cell receptor stimulation. Because it binds Shc independent of stimulation and Grb2 after stimulation, it appears to play a role in signal transduction from the receptor to the Shc/Grb2 pathway.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a member of the serum amyloid A family of apolipoproteins. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate the mature protein. This protein is a major acute phase protein that is highly expressed in response to inflammation and tissue injury. This protein also plays an important role in HDL metabolism and cholesterol homeostasis. High levels of this protein are associated with chronic inflammatory diseases including atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer's disease and Crohn's disease. This protein may also be a potential biomarker for certain tumors. Finally, antimicrobial activity against S. aureus and E. coli resides in the N-terminal portion of the mature protein. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants that encode the same protein. A pseudogene of this gene is found on chromosome 11.","Variant counts

The mammalian sperm flagellum contains two cytoskeletal structures associated with the axoneme: the outer dense fibers surrounding the axoneme in the midpiece and principal piece and the fibrous sheath surrounding the outer dense fibers in the principal piece of the tail. Defects in these structures are associated with abnormal tail morphology, reduced sperm motility, and infertility. In the rat, the protein encoded by this gene associates with an outer dense fiber protein via a leucine zipper motif and localizes to the microtubules of the manchette and axoneme during sperm tail development. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene contains a SH2 domain and a CIS homolog domain. The protein thus belongs to the cytokine-induced STAT inhibitor (CIS), also known as suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) or STAT-induced STAT inhibitor (SSI), protein family. CIS family members are known to be cytokine-inducible negative regulators of cytokine signaling. The expression of this gene can be induced by GM-CSF and EPO in hematopoietic cells. A high expression level of this gene was found in factor-independent chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and erythroleukemia (HEL) cell lines.","Variant counts
The variants found in rare patients tested by 3billion are classified and counted according to ACMG guidelines. The variants with over 5% variant frequency in population genome databases ( gnomAD, dbSNP, etc) are excluded.

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the STAT-induced STAT inhibitor (SSI), also known as suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS), family. SSI family members are cytokine-inducible negative regulators of cytokine signaling. The expression of this gene can be induced by a subset of cytokines, including IL2, IL3 erythropoietin (EPO), CSF2/GM-CSF, and interferon (IFN)-gamma. The protein encoded by this gene functions downstream of cytokine receptors, and takes part in a negative feedback loop to attenuate cytokine signaling. Knockout studies in mice suggested the role of this gene as a modulator of IFN-gamma action, which is required for normal postnatal growth and survival.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family. SOCS family members are cytokine-inducible negative regulators of cytokine receptor signaling via the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activation of transcription pathway (the JAK/STAT pathway). SOCS family proteins interact with major molecules of signaling complexes to block further signal transduction, in part, by proteasomal depletion of receptors or signal-transducing proteins via ubiquitination. The expression of this gene can be induced by a subset of cytokines, including erythropoietin, GM-CSF, IL10, interferon (IFN)-gamma and by cytokine receptors such as growth horomone receptor. The protein encoded by this gene interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) and is thought to be involved in the regulation of IGF1R mediated cell signaling. This gene has pseudogenes on chromosomes 20 and 22. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
Cholesterol homeostasis is regulated, at least in part, by sterol regulatory element (SRE)-binding proteins (e.g., SREBP1; MIM 184756) and by liver X receptors (e.g., LXRA; MIM 602423). Upon sterol depletion, LXRs are inactive and SREBPs are cleaved, after which they bind promoter SREs and activate genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and uptake. Sterol transport is mediated by vesicles or by soluble protein carriers, such as steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (STAR; MIM 600617). STAR is homologous to a family of proteins containing a 200- to 210-amino acid STAR-related lipid transfer (START) domain, including STARD6 (Soccio et al., 2002 [PubMed 12011452]).","Variant counts

Summary
Endocytosis of cell surface proteins is mediated by a complex molecular machinery that assembles on the inner surface of the plasma membrane. This gene encodes one of two human homologs of the Drosophila melanogaster stoned B protein. This protein is related to components of the endocytic machinery and exhibits a modular structure consisting of an N-terminal proline-rich domain, a central region of homology specific to the human stoned B-like proteins, and a C-terminal region homologous to the mu subunits of adaptor protein (AP) complexes. Read-through transcription of this gene into the neighboring downstream gene, which encodes TFIIA-alpha/beta-like factor, generates a transcript (SALF), which encodes a fusion protein comprised of sequence sharing identity with each individual gene product. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein present at the cell surface. The N-terminus has sequence similarity to human cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) type II alpha regulatory subunit (RIIa) while the C-terminus has an IQ calmodulin-binding motif. The central portion of the protein has carbohydrate binding motifs and likely functions in cell-cell adhesion. The protein was initially characterized by its involvement in the binding of sperm to the zona pellucida of the oocyte. Recent studies indicate that it is also involved in additional cell-cell adhesion functions such as immune cell migration and metastasis. A retrotransposed pseudogene is present on chromosome 10q22.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of a small family of acyl coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferases. The gene encodes a membrane-bound enzyme localized in the endoplasmic reticulum that produces intracellular cholesterol esters from long-chain fatty acyl CoA and cholesterol. The cholesterol esters are then stored as cytoplasmic lipid droplets inside the cell. The enzyme is implicated in cholesterol absorption in the intestine and in the assembly and secretion of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins such as very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). Several alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been described, but their full-length nature is not known.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene belongs to the SMC3 subfamily of SMC proteins. The encoded protein occurs in certain cell types as either an intracellular, nuclear protein or a secreted protein. The nuclear form, known as structural maintenance of chromosomes 3, is a component of the multimeric cohesin complex that holds together sister chromatids during mitosis, enabling proper chromosome segregation. Post-translational modification of the encoded protein by the addition of chondroitin sulfate chains gives rise to the secreted proteoglycan bamacan, an abundant basement membrane protein.","Variant counts

Summary
Sperm mitochondria differ in morphology and subcellular localization from those of somatic cells. They are elongated, flattened, and arranged circumferentially to form a helical coiled sheath in the midpiece of the sperm flagellum. The protein encoded by this gene localizes to the capsule associated with the mitochondrial outer membranes and is thought to function in the organization and stabilization of the helical structure of the sperm's mitochondrial sheath.","Variant counts

This gene is a member of the synaptotagmin gene family and encodes a protein similar to other family members that mediate calcium-dependent regulation of membrane trafficking in synaptic transmission. Studies of the orthologous gene in rat have shown that the encoded protein selectively modulates spontaneous synaptic-vesicle exocytosis and may also be involved in regulating calcium independent secretion in nonneuronal cells. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. The gene has previously been referred to as synaptotagmin XI but has been renamed synaptotagmin XII to be standard with mouse and rat official nomenclature.","Variant counts

Summary
Polyspecific organic cation transporters in the liver, kidney, intestine, and other organs are critical for elimination of many endogenous small organic cations as well as a wide array of drugs and environmental toxins. The encoded protein is a plasma integral membrane protein which functions both as an organic cation transporter and as a sodium-dependent high affinity carnitine transporter. The encoded protein is involved in the active cellular uptake of carnitine. Mutations in this gene are the cause of systemic primary carnitine deficiency (CDSP), an autosomal recessive disorder manifested early in life by hypoketotic hypoglycemia and acute metabolic decompensation, and later in life by skeletal myopathy or cardiomyopathy. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a member of the Rho GTPase activating protein (RhoGAP) family. The encoded protein regulates Rac signaling and plays a role in cytoskeletal dynamics, cell motility and epithelial junction formation. This protein's association with the exocyst complex, which tethers secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane, has been demonstrated to be important in cell motility. In a distinct complex, this protein has been shown to regulate epithelial junction formation and morphogenesis. By interacting with the Plexin-D1 cell surface receptor, this protein mediates changes in the cytoskeleton in response to semaphorin binding. This protein may promote metastasis in human liver cancer cells and tissues.","Variant counts

This gene encodes the 72 kDa subunit of the signal recognition particle (SRP), a ribonucleoprotein complex that mediates the targeting of secretory proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The SRP complex consists of a 7S RNA and 6 protein subunits: SRP9, SRP14, SRP19, SRP54, SRP68, and SRP72, that are bound to the 7S RNA as monomers or heterodimers. SRP has at least 3 distinct functions that can be associated with the protein subunits: signal recognition, translational arrest, and ER membrane targeting by interaction with the docking protein. Mutations in this gene are associated with familial bone marrow failure. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Secretory carrier membrane proteins (SCAMPs) are widely distributed integral membrane proteins implicated in membrane trafficking. Most SCAMPs (e.g., SCAMP1; MIM 606911) have N-terminal cytoplasmic NPF (arg-pro-phe) repeats, 4 central transmembrane regions, and a short C-terminal cytoplasmic tail. These SCAMPs likely have a role in endocytosis that is mediated by their NPF repeats. Other SCAMPs, such as SCAMP4, lack the NPF repeats and are therefore unlikely to function in endocytosis (summary by Fernandez-Chacon and Sudhof, 2000 [PubMed 11050114]).","Variant counts

This gene product belongs to the SCAMP family of proteins which are secretory carrier membrane proteins. They function as carriers to the cell surface in post-golgi recycling pathways. Different family members are highly related products of distinct genes, and are usually expressed together. These findings suggest that the SCAMPs may function at the same site during vesicular transport rather than in separate pathways. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes two proteins: sterol carrier protein X (SCPx) and sterol carrier protein 2 (SCP2), as a result of transcription initiation from 2 independently regulated promoters. The transcript initiated from the proximal promoter encodes the longer SCPx protein, and the transcript initiated from the distal promoter encodes the shorter SCP2 protein, with the 2 proteins sharing a common C-terminus. Evidence suggests that the SCPx protein is a peroxisome-associated thiolase that is involved in the oxidation of branched chain fatty acids, while the SCP2 protein is thought to be an intracellular lipid transfer protein. This gene is highly expressed in organs involved in lipid metabolism, and may play a role in Zellweger syndrome, in which cells are deficient in peroxisomes and have impaired bile acid synthesis. Alternative splicing of this gene produces multiple transcript variants, some encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
Members of arrestin/beta-arrestin protein family are thought to participate in agonist-mediated desensitization of G-protein-coupled receptors and cause specific dampening of cellular responses to stimuli such as hormones, neurotransmitters, or sensory signals. S-arrestin, also known as S-antigen, is a major soluble photoreceptor protein that is involved in desensitization of the photoactivated transduction cascade. It is expressed in the retina and the pineal gland and inhibits coupling of rhodopsin to transducin in vitro. Additionally, S-arrestin is highly antigenic, and is capable of inducing experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis. Mutations in this gene have been associated with Oguchi disease, a rare autosomal recessive form of night blindness.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the production of monoselenophosphate (MSP) from selenide and ATP. MSP is the selenium donor required for synthesis of selenocysteine (Sec), which is co-translationally incorporated into selenoproteins at in-frame UGA codons that normally signal translation termination. The 3' UTRs of selenoprotein mRNAs contain a conserved stem-loop structure, the Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element, which is necessary for the recognition of UGA as a Sec codon rather than as a stop signal. This protein is itself a selenoprotein containing a Sec residue at its active site, suggesting the existence of an autoregulatory mechanism. It is preferentially expressed in tissues implicated in the synthesis of selenoproteins and in sites of blood cell development. A pseudogene for this locus has been identified on chromosome 5.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a coiled-coil-forming protein that associates with the SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptor) complex of proteins and the BLOC-1 (biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles) complex. Biochemical studies have identified additional binding partners. As part of the SNARE complex, it is required for vesicle docking and fusion and regulates neurotransmitter release. The BLOC-1 complex is required for the biogenesis of specialized organelles such as melanosomes and platelet dense granules. Mutations in gene products that form the BLOC-1 complex have been identified in mouse strains that are models of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene is a homolog of the U1-snRNP binding protein. The N-terminal half contains a RNA recognition motif and the C-terminal half is rich in Arg/Asp and Arg/Glu dipeptides, which is a characteristic of a variety of splicing factors. This protein is a component of the U11/U12 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP) that form part of the U12-type spliceosome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding two distinct isoforms and representing a non-protein coding variant.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the shugoshin family of proteins. This protein is thought to protect centromeric cohesin from cleavage during mitotic prophase by preventing phosphorylation of a cohesin subunit. Reduced expression of this gene leads to the premature loss of centromeric cohesion, mis-segregation of sister chromatids, and mitotic arrest. Evidence suggests that this protein also protects a small subset of cohesin found along the length of the chromosome arms during mitotic prophase. An isoform lacking exon 6 has been shown to play a role in the cohesion of centrioles (PMID: 16582621 and PMID:18331714). Mutations in this gene have been associated with Chronic Atrial and Intestinal Dysrhythmia (CAID) syndrome, characterized by the co-occurrence of Sick Sinus Syndrome (SSS) and Chronic Intestinal Pseudo-obstruction (CIPO) within the first four decades of life (PMID:25282101). Fibroblast cells from CAID patients exhibited both increased cell proliferation and higher rates of senescence. Pseudogenes of this gene have been found on chromosomes 1 and 7. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a protein belonging to the syntrophin family. Syntrophins are cytoplasmic peripheral membrane proteins that bind to components of mechanosenstive sodium channels and the extreme carboxy-terminal domain of dystrophin and dystrophin-related proteins. The PDZ domain of this protein product interacts with a protein component of a mechanosensitive sodium channel that affects channel gating. Absence or reduction of this protein product has been associated with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. There is evidence of alternative splicing yet the full-length nature of these variants has not been described.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the high-affinity glutamate transporters that play an essential role in transporting glutamate across plasma membranes. In brain, these transporters are crucial in terminating the postsynaptic action of the neurotransmitter glutamate, and in maintaining extracellular glutamate concentrations below neurotoxic levels. This transporter also transports aspartate, and mutations in this gene are thought to cause dicarboxylicamino aciduria, also known as glutamate-aspartate transport defect.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of a family of solute transporter proteins. The membrane-bound protein is the principal transporter that clears the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate from the extracellular space at synapses in the central nervous system. Glutamate clearance is necessary for proper synaptic activation and to prevent neuronal damage from excessive activation of glutamate receptors. Improper regulation of this gene is thought to be associated with several neurological disorders. Alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been identified.","Variant counts

Summary
The product of this gene belongs to the family of highly homologous synovial sarcoma X (SSX) breakpoint proteins. These proteins may function as transcriptional repressors. They are also capable of eliciting spontaneous humoral and cellular immune responses in cancer patients, and are potentially useful targets in cancer vaccine-based immunotherapy. This gene, and also the SSX1 and SSX4 family members, have been involved in t(X;18)(p11.2;q11.2) translocations that are characteristically found in all synovial sarcomas. This translocation results in the fusion of the synovial sarcoma translocation gene on chromosome 18 to one of the SSX genes on chromosome X. The encoded hybrid proteins are likely responsible for transforming activity. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants. This gene also has an identical duplicate, GeneID: 6757, located about 45 kb upstream in the opposite orientation on chromosome X.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes subunit 1 of the splicing factor 3b protein complex. Splicing factor 3b, together with splicing factor 3a and a 12S RNA unit, forms the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins complex (U2 snRNP). The splicing factor 3b/3a complex binds pre-mRNA upstream of the intron's branch site in a sequence independent manner and may anchor the U2 snRNP to the pre-mRNA. Splicing factor 3b is also a component of the minor U12-type spliceosome. The carboxy-terminal two-thirds of subunit 1 have 22 non-identical, tandem HEAT repeats that form rod-like, helical structures. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the syntaxin superfamily. Syntaxins are nervous system-specific proteins implicated in the docking of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic plasma membrane. Syntaxins possess a single C-terminal transmembrane domain, a SNARE [Soluble NSF (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein)-Attachment protein REceptor] domain (known as H3), and an N-terminal regulatory domain (Habc). Syntaxins bind synaptotagmin in a calcium-dependent fashion and interact with voltage dependent calcium and potassium channels via the C-terminal H3 domain. This gene product is a key molecule in ion channel regulation and synaptic exocytosis. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to a family of proteins thought to play a role in the exocytosis of synaptic vesicles. Vesicle exocytosis releases vesicular contents and is important to various cellular functions. For instance, the secretion of transmitters from neurons plays an important role in synaptic transmission. After exocytosis, the membrane and proteins from the vesicle are retrieved from the plasma membrane through the process of endocytosis. Mutations in this gene have been identified as one cause of fever-associated epilepsy syndromes. A possible link between this gene and Parkinson's disease has also been suggested.","Variant counts

Summary
Sulfite oxidase is a homodimeric protein localized to the intermembrane space of mitochondria. Each subunit contains a heme domain and a molybdopterin-binding domain. The enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of sulfite to sulfate, the final reaction in the oxidative degradation of the sulfur amino acids cysteine and methionine. Sulfite oxidase deficiency results in neurological abnormalities which are often fatal at an early age. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding identical proteins.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the serine/threonine kinase family of enzymes. This family member is similar to a Drosophila protein that plays a key role in the Hedgehog signaling pathway. This human protein is a positive regulator of the GLI zinc-finger transcription factors. Knockout studies of the homologous mouse gene suggest that defects in this human gene may lead to congenital hydrocephalus, possibly due to a functional defect in motile cilia. Because Hedgehog signaling is frequently activated in certain kinds of gastrointestinal cancers, it has been suggested that this gene is a target for the treatment of these cancers. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a serine/threonine kinase that is thought to function in the cellular stress response pathway. The kinase is activated in response to hypotonic stress, leading to phosphorylation of several cation-chloride-coupled cotransporters. The catalytically active kinase specifically activates the p38 MAP kinase pathway, and its interaction with p38 decreases upon cellular stress, suggesting that this kinase may serve as an intermediate in the response to cellular stress.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the semaphorin family of soluble and transmembrane proteins. Semaphorins are involved in numerous functions, including axon guidance, morphogenesis, carcinogenesis, and immunomodulation. The encoded protein is a single-pass type I membrane protein containing an immunoglobulin-like C2-type domain, a PSI domain and a sema domain. It inhibits axonal extension by providing local signals to specify territories inaccessible for growing axons. It is an activator of T-cell-mediated immunity and suppresses vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mediated endothelial cell migration and proliferation in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo. Mutations in this gene are associated with retinal degenerative diseases including retinitis pigmentosa type 35 (RP35) and cone-rod dystrophy type 10 (CORD10). Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that is a member of the SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) protein family. It functions in a manner similar to ubiquitin in that it is bound to target proteins as part of a post-translational modification system. However, unlike ubiquitin which targets proteins for degradation, this protein is involved in a variety of cellular processes, such as nuclear transport, transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, and protein stability. It is not active until the last two amino acids of the carboxy-terminus have been cleaved off. Numerous pseudogenes have been reported for this gene. Alternate transcriptional splice variants, encoding different isoforms, have been characterized.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes an ETS-domain transcription factor that activates gene expression during myeloid and B-lymphoid cell development. The nuclear protein binds to a purine-rich sequence known as the PU-box found near the promoters of target genes, and regulates their expression in coordination with other transcription factors and cofactors. The protein can also regulate alternative splicing of target genes. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
SIM1 and SIM2 genes are Drosophila single-minded (sim) gene homologs. SIM1 transcript was detected only in fetal kidney out of various adult and fetal tissues tested. Since the sim gene plays an important role in Drosophila development and has peak levels of expression during the period of neurogenesis,it was proposed that the human SIM gene is a candidate for involvement in certain dysmorphic features (particularly the facial and skull characteristics), abnormalities of brain development, and/or cognitive disability of Down syndrome.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a Ras GTPase activating protein that is a member of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor complex. The N-terminal domain of the protein contains a Ras-GAP domain, a pleckstrin homology domain, and a C2 domain that may be involved in binding of calcium and phospholipids. The C-terminal domain consists of a ten histidine repeat region, serine and tyrosine phosphorylation sites, and a T/SXV motif required for postsynaptic scaffold protein interaction. The encoded protein negatively regulates Ras, Rap and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor trafficking to the postsynaptic membrane to regulate synaptic plasticity and neuronal homeostasis. Allelic variants of this gene are associated with intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the STAT family of transcription factors. In response to cytokines and growth factors, STAT family members are phosphorylated by the receptor associated kinases, and then form homo- or heterodimers that translocate to the cell nucleus where they act as transcription activators. This protein plays a central role in exerting IL4 mediated biological responses. It is found to induce the expression of BCL2L1/BCL-X(L), which is responsible for the anti-apoptotic activity of IL4. Knockout studies in mice suggested the roles of this gene in differentiation of T helper 2 (Th2) cells, expression of cell surface markers, and class switch of immunoglobulins. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the STAT protein family. In response to cytokines and growth factors, STAT family members are phosphorylated by the receptor associated kinases, and then form homo- or heterodimers that translocate to the cell nucleus where they act as transcription activators. This protein is activated through phosphorylation in response to various cytokines and growth factors including IFNs, EGF, IL5, IL6, HGF, LIF and BMP2. This protein mediates the expression of a variety of genes in response to cell stimuli, and thus plays a key role in many cellular processes such as cell growth and apoptosis. The small GTPase Rac1 has been shown to bind and regulate the activity of this protein. PIAS3 protein is a specific inhibitor of this protein. This gene also plays a role in regulating host response to viral and bacterial infections. Mutations in this gene are associated with infantile-onset multisystem autoimmune disease and hyper-immunoglobulin E syndrome.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene is found in cytokine-stimulated endothelial cells and is thought to be responsible for the accumulation of blood leukocytes at sites of inflammation by mediating the adhesion of cells to the vascular lining. It exhibits structural features such as the presence of lectin- and EGF-like domains followed by short consensus repeat (SCR) domains that contain 6 conserved cysteine residues. These proteins are part of the selectin family of cell adhesion molecules. Adhesion molecules participate in the interaction between leukocytes and the endothelium and appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of a heteromeric, sodium-independent, anionic amino acid transport system that is highly specific for cysteine and glutamate. In this system, designated Xc(-), the anionic form of cysteine is transported in exchange for glutamate. This protein has been identified as the predominant mediator of Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus fusion and entry permissiveness into cells. Also, increased expression of this gene in primary gliomas (compared to normal brain tissue) was associated with increased glutamate secretion via the XCT channels, resulting in neuronal cell death.","Variant counts
