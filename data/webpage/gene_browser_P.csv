Summary
This intronless gene was thought to be a transcribed pseudogene of POU class 5 homeobox 1, however, it has been reported that this gene can encode a functional protein. The encoded protein is nearly the same length as and highly similar to the POU class 5 homeobox 1 transcription factor, has been shown to be a weak transcriptional activator and may play a role in carcinogenesis and eye development.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene contains a paired-like homeodomain most similar to that of the Drosophila aristaless gene product. The encoded protein plays a central role in development of the autonomic nervous system. It regulates the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine beta-hydroxylase, two catecholaminergic biosynthetic enzymes essential for the differentiation and maintenance of the noradrenergic neurotransmitter phenotype. The encoded protein has also been shown to regulate transcription of the alpha3 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor gene. Mutations in this gene have been associated with autosomal recessive congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles.","Variant counts

Summary
The DNA-associated protein encoded by this gene is a member of the paired family of homeobox proteins localized to the nucleus. The protein functions as a transcription factor involved in the development of several major noradrenergic neuron populations and the determination of neurotransmitter phenotype. The gene product is linked to enhancement of second messenger-mediated activation of the dopamine beta-hydroylase, c-fos promoters and several enhancers, including cyclic amp-response element and serum-response element. Expansion of a 20 amino acid polyalanine tract in this protein by 5-13 aa has been associated with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome.","Variant counts

Summary
cAMP is a signaling molecule important for a variety of cellular functions. cAMP exerts its effects by activating the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, which transduces the signal through phosphorylation of different target proteins. The inactive kinase holoenzyme is a tetramer composed of two regulatory and two catalytic subunits. cAMP causes the dissociation of the inactive holoenzyme into a dimer of regulatory subunits bound to four cAMP and two free monomeric catalytic subunits. Four different regulatory subunits and three catalytic subunits have been identified in humans. The protein encoded by this gene is one of the regulatory subunits. This subunit can be phosphorylated by the activated catalytic subunit. It may interact with various A-kinase anchoring proteins and determine the subcellular localization of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. This subunit has been shown to regulate protein transport from endosomes to the Golgi apparatus and further to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).","Variant counts

This subunit can be phosphorylated by the activated catalytic subunit. This subunit has been shown to interact with and suppress the transcriptional activity of the cAMP responsive element binding protein 1 (CREB1) in activated T cells. Knockout studies in mice suggest that this subunit may play an important role in regulating energy balance and adiposity. The studies also suggest that this subunit may mediate the gene induction and cataleptic behavior induced by haloperidol.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the patched family of proteins and a component of the hedgehog signaling pathway. Hedgehog signaling is important in embryonic development and tumorigenesis. The encoded protein is the receptor for the secreted hedgehog ligands, which include sonic hedgehog, indian hedgehog and desert hedgehog. Following binding by one of the hedgehog ligands, the encoded protein is trafficked away from the primary cilium, relieving inhibition of the G-protein-coupled receptor smoothened, which results in activation of downstream signaling. Mutations of this gene have been associated with basal cell nevus syndrome and holoprosencephaly.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family. PTPs are signaling molecules that regulate a variety of cellular processes including cell growth, differentiation, mitotic cycle, and oncogenic transformation. This PTP is a large intracellular protein. It has a catalytic PTP domain at its C-terminus and two major structural domains: a region with five PDZ domains and a FERM domain that binds to plasma membrane and cytoskeletal elements. This PTP was found to interact with, and dephosphorylate, Fas receptor and IkappaBalpha through the PDZ domains. This suggests it has a role in Fas mediated programmed cell death. This PTP was also shown to interact with GTPase-activating protein, and thus may function as a regulator of Rho signaling pathways. Four alternatively spliced transcript variants, which encode distinct proteins, have been reported.","Variant counts

Summary
Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is a mitochondrial multienzyme complex that catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate and is one of the major enzymes responsible for the regulation of homeostasis of carbohydrate fuels in mammals. The enzymatic activity is regulated by a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle. Phosphorylation of PDH by a specific pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) results in inactivation. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial multienzyme complex that catalyzes the overall conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and CO(2). It provides the primary link between glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and thus is one of the major enzymes responsible for the regulation of glucose metabolism. The enzymatic activity of PDH is regulated by a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle, and phosphorylation results in inactivation of PDH. The protein encoded by this gene is one of the three pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases that inhibits the PDH complex by phosphorylation of the E1 alpha subunit. This gene is predominantly expressed in the heart and skeletal muscles. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The proteasome is a multicatalytic proteinase complex with a highly ordered ring-shaped 20S core structure. The core structure is composed of 4 rings of 28 non-identical subunits; 2 rings are composed of 7 alpha subunits and 2 rings are composed of 7 beta subunits. Proteasomes are distributed throughout eukaryotic cells at a high concentration and cleave peptides in an ATP/ubiquitin-dependent process in a non-lysosomal pathway. An essential function of a modified proteasome, the immunoproteasome, is the processing of class I MHC peptides. This gene encodes a member of the proteasome B-type family, also known as the T1B family, that is a 20S core beta subunit. This gene is located in the class II region of the MHC (major histocompatibility complex). Expression of this gene is induced by gamma interferon and this gene product replaces catalytic subunit 1 (proteasome beta 6 subunit) in the immunoproteasome. Proteolytic processing is required to generate a mature subunit.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the secretory phospholipase A2 family. It is located in a tightly-linked cluster of secretory phospholipase A2 genes on chromosome 1. The encoded enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids to generate lysophospholipids and free fatty acids including arachidonic acid. It preferentially hydrolyzes linoleoyl-containing phosphatidylcholine substrates. Secretion of this enzyme is thought to induce inflammatory responses in neighboring cells. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found, but their full-length nature has not been determined.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene binds to calmodulin and is expressed in the centrosome. It is an integral component of the pericentriolar material (PCM). The protein contains a series of coiled-coil domains and a highly conserved PCM targeting motif called the PACT domain near its C-terminus. The protein interacts with the microtubule nucleation component gamma-tubulin and is likely important to normal functioning of the centrosomes, cytoskeleton, and cell-cycle progression. Mutations in this gene cause Seckel syndrome-4 and microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that is conserved across metazoans. In vertebrates, this gene is linked in a head-to-head arrangement with the adjacent parkin gene, which is associated with autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinson's disease. These genes are co-regulated in various tissues and they share a bi-directional promoter. Both genes are associated with susceptibility to leprosy. The parkin co-regulated gene protein forms a large molecular complex with chaperones, including heat shock proteins 70 and 90, and chaperonin components. This protein is also a component of Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease patients, and it suppresses unfolded Pael receptor-induced neuronal cell death. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the subtilisin-like proprotein convertase family, which includes proteases that process protein and peptide precursors trafficking through regulated or constitutive branches of the secretory pathway. The encoded protein undergoes an autocatalytic processing event with its prosegment in the ER and is constitutively secreted as an inactive protease into the extracellular matrix and trans-Golgi network. It is expressed in liver, intestine and kidney tissues and escorts specific receptors for lysosomal degradation. It plays a role in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism. Mutations in this gene have been associated with autosomal dominant familial hypercholesterolemia. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the subtilisin-like proprotein convertase family, which includes proteases that process protein and peptide precursors trafficking through regulated or constitutive branches of the secretory pathway. The protein undergoes an initial autocatalytic processing event and interacts with a neuroendocrine secretory protein in the ER, exits the ER and sorts to secretory granules, where it is cleaved and catalytically activated during intracellular transport. The encoded protease is packaged into and activated in dense core secretory granules and expressed in the neuroendocrine system and brain. This gene encodes one of the seven basic amino acid-specific members which cleave their substrates at single or paired basic residues. It functions in the proteolytic activation of polypeptide hormones and neuropeptides precursors. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in this gene may increase susceptibility to myocardial infarction and type 2 diabetes. This gene may also play a role in tumor development and progression. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the protocadherin alpha gene cluster, one of three related gene clusters tandemly linked on chromosome five that demonstrate an unusual genomic organization similar to that of B-cell and T-cell receptor gene clusters. The alpha gene cluster is composed of 15 cadherin superfamily genes related to the mouse CNR genes and consists of 13 highly similar and 2 more distantly related coding sequences. The tandem array of 15 N-terminal exons, or variable exons, are followed by downstream C-terminal exons, or constant exons, which are shared by all genes in the cluster. The large, uninterrupted N-terminal exons each encode six cadherin ectodomains while the C-terminal exons encode the cytoplasmic domain. These neural cadherin-like cell adhesion proteins are integral plasma membrane proteins that most likely play a critical role in the establishment and function of specific cell-cell connections in the brain. Alternative splicing has been observed and additional variants have been suggested but their full-length nature has yet to be determined.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the phospholipase A2 family (PLA2). PLA2s constitute a diverse family of enzymes with respect to sequence, function, localization, and divalent cation requirements. This gene product belongs to group II, which contains secreted form of PLA2, an extracellular enzyme that has a low molecular mass and requires calcium ions for catalysis. It catalyzes the hydrolysis of the sn-2 fatty acid acyl ester bond of phosphoglycerides, releasing free fatty acids and lysophospholipids, and thought to participate in the regulation of the phospholipid metabolism in biomembranes. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants with different 5' UTRs have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a transcriptional activator of several genes, including insulin, somatostatin, glucokinase, islet amyloid polypeptide, and glucose transporter type 2. The encoded nuclear protein is involved in the early development of the pancreas and plays a major role in glucose-dependent regulation of insulin gene expression. Defects in this gene are a cause of pancreatic agenesis, which can lead to early-onset insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), as well as maturity onset diabetes of the young type 4 (MODY4).","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a membrane-bound homodimeric enzyme that is localized to the cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The enzyme (cofactors iron and ascorbate) catalyzes the hydroxylation of lysyl residues in collagen-like peptides. The resultant hydroxylysyl groups are attachment sites for carbohydrates in collagen and thus are critical for the stability of intermolecular crosslinks. Some patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIB have deficiencies in lysyl hydroxylase activity.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of a small family of genes derived from piggyBac transposable elements. The encoded protein contains a zinc-ribbon domain characteristic of transposon-derived proteins and may function as a regulator of transcription. Alternative splicing occurs between a splice site from exon 5 of the adjacent upstream gene 'excision repair cross-complementation group 6' (ERCC6, GeneID: 2074) and the 3' splice site upstream of the open reading frame (ORF) of this gene, which activates the alternative polyadenylation site downstream of the piggyback-derived-3 ORF. The resulting transcripts encode a fusion protein that shares sequence with the product of each individual gene. Pseudogenes for this gene are defined on chromosomes 4, 5 and 12.","Variant counts

The 26S proteasome is a multicatalytic proteinase complex with a highly ordered structure composed of 2 complexes, a 20S core and a 19S regulator. The 20S core is composed of 4 rings of 28 non-identical subunits; 2 rings are composed of 7 alpha subunits and 2 rings are composed of 7 beta subunits. The 19S regulator is composed of a base, which contains 6 ATPase subunits and 2 non-ATPase subunits, and a lid, which contains up to 10 non-ATPase subunits. Proteasomes are distributed throughout eukaryotic cells at a high concentration and cleave peptides in an ATP/ubiquitin-dependent process in a non-lysosomal pathway. This gene encodes a member of the proteasome subunit S9 family that functions as a non-ATPase subunit of the 19S regulator and is phosphorylated by AMP-activated protein kinase. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been observed for this gene.","Variant counts

The 26S proteasome is a multicatalytic proteinase complex with a highly ordered structure composed of 2 complexes, a 20S core and a 19S regulator. The 20S core is composed of 4 rings of 28 non-identical subunits; 2 rings are composed of 7 alpha subunits and 2 rings are composed of 7 beta subunits. The 19S regulator is composed of a base, which contains 6 ATPase subunits and 2 non-ATPase subunits, and a lid, which contains up to 10 non-ATPase subunits. Proteasomes are distributed throughout eukaryotic cells at a high concentration and cleave peptides in an ATP/ubiquitin-dependent process in a non-lysosomal pathway. An essential function of a modified proteasome, the immunoproteasome, is the processing of class I MHC peptides. This gene encodes a non-ATPase subunit of the 19S regulator. Two transcripts encoding different isoforms have been described.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a multifunctional protein. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate the mature enzyme. This enzyme includes two domains with distinct catalytic activities, a peptidylglycine alpha-hydroxylating monooxygenase (PHM) domain and a peptidyl-alpha-hydroxyglycine alpha-amidating lyase (PAL) domain. These catalytic domains work sequentially to catalyze the conversion of neuroendocrine peptides to active alpha-amidated products. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, at least one of which encodes an isoform that is proteolytically processed.","Variant counts

Summary
The pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial multienzyme complex that catalyzes the overall conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and CO(2), and provides the primary link between glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The PDH complex is composed of multiple copies of three enzymatic components: pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1), dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (E2) and lipoamide dehydrogenase (E3). The E1 enzyme is a heterotetramer of two alpha and two beta subunits. This gene encodes the E1 alpha 1 subunit containing the E1 active site, and plays a key role in the function of the PDH complex. Mutations in this gene are associated with pyruvate dehydrogenase E1-alpha deficiency and X-linked Leigh syndrome. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The human pregnancy-specific glycoproteins (PSGs) are a family of proteins that are synthesized in large amounts by placental trophoblasts and released into the maternal circulation during pregnancy. Molecular cloning and analysis of several PSG genes has indicated that the PSGs form a subgroup of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) gene family, which belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily of genes. Members of the CEA family consist of a single N domain, with structural similarity to the immunoglobulin variable domains, followed by a variable number of immunoglobulin constant-like A and/or B domains. Most PSGs have an arg-gly-asp (RGD) motif, which has been shown to function as an adhesion recognition signal for several integrins, in the N-terminal domain (summary by Teglund et al., 1994 [PubMed 7851896]).

Summary
The proteasome is a multicatalytic proteinase complex with a highly ordered ring-shaped 20S core structure. The core structure is composed of 4 rings of 28 non-identical subunits; 2 rings are composed of 7 alpha subunits and 2 rings are composed of 7 beta subunits. Proteasomes are distributed throughout eukaryotic cells at a high concentration and cleave peptides in an ATP/ubiquitin-dependent process in a non-lysosomal pathway. An essential function of a modified proteasome, the immunoproteasome, is the processing of class I MHC peptides. This gene encodes a member of the proteasome B-type family, also known as the T1B family, that is a 20S core beta subunit.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 and adenovirus E1B 19 kDa interacting family, whose members play roles in many cellular processes including apotosis, cell transformation, and synaptic function. Several functions for this protein have been demonstrated including suppression of Ras homolog family member A activity, which results in reduced stress fiber formation and suppression of oncogenic cellular transformation. A high molecular weight isoform of this protein has also been shown to colocalize with Adaptor protein complex 2, beta-Adaptin and endodermal markers, suggesting an involvement in post-endocytic trafficking. In prostate cancer cells, this gene acts as a tumor suppressor and its expression is regulated by prostate cancer antigen 3, a non-protein coding gene on the opposite DNA strand in an intron of this gene. Prostate cancer antigen 3 regulates levels of this gene through formation of a double-stranded RNA that undergoes adenosine deaminase actin on RNA-dependent adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the transmembrane 4 superfamily, also known as the tetraspanin family. Most of these members are cell-surface proteins that are characterized by the presence of four hydrophobic domains. The proteins mediate signal transduction events that play a role in the regulation of cell development, activation, growth and motility. This encoded protein is a cell surface glycoprotein found in the outer segment of both rod and cone photoreceptor cells. It may function as an adhesion molecule involved in stabilization and compaction of outer segment disks or in the maintenance of the curvature of the rim. This protein is essential for disk morphogenesis. Defects in this gene are associated with both central and peripheral retinal degenerations. Some of the various phenotypically different disorders are autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, progressive macular degeneration, macular dystrophy and retinitis pigmentosa digenic.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a vitamin K-dependent plasma protein that functions as a cofactor for the anticoagulant protease, activated protein C (APC) to inhibit blood coagulation. It is found in plasma in both a free, functionally active form and also in an inactive form complexed with C4b-binding protein. Mutations in this gene result in autosomal dominant hereditary thrombophilia. An inactive pseudogene of this locus is located at an adjacent region on chromosome 3. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms that may undergo similar processing to generate mature protein.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the phospholipase A2 (PLA2) group of enzymes, which function in glycolipid hydrolysis with the release of free fatty acids and lysophospholipids. This family member has altered phospholipid-binding properties and is catalytically inactive. The protein is secreted, and together with microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, it functions to regulate HNF4alpha-induced hepatitis C virus infectivity. The expression of this gene is down-regulated in various tumors, suggesting that it may function as a negative regulator of tumor progression. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene contains a leucine-rich repeat and a death domain. This protein has been shown to interact with other death domain proteins, such as Fas (TNFRSF6)-associated via death domain (FADD) and MAP-kinase activating death domain-containing protein (MADD), and thus may function as an adaptor protein in cell death-related signaling processes. The expression of the mouse counterpart of this gene has been found to be positively regulated by the tumor suppressor p53 and to induce cell apoptosis in response to DNA damage, which suggests a role for this gene as an effector of p53-dependent apoptosis. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family. PTPs are known to be signaling molecules that regulate a variety of cellular processes including cell growth, differentiation, mitotic cycle, and oncogenic transformation. This PTP contains an N-terminal domain, similar to cytoskeletal- associated proteins including band 4.1, ezrin, merlin, and radixin. This PTP was shown to specially interact with BMX/ETK, a member of Tec tyrosine kinase family characterized by a multimodular structures including PH, SH3, and SH2 domains. The interaction of this PTP with BMX kinase was found to increase the activation of STAT3, but not STAT2 kinase. Studies of the similar gene in mice suggested the possible roles of this PTP in liver regeneration and spermatogenesis.","Variant counts

Summary
The pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex is located in the mitochondrial matrix and catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl coenzyme A. The PDH complex thereby links glycolysis to Krebs cycle. The PDH complex contains three catalytic subunits, E1, E2, and E3, two regulatory subunits, E1 kinase and E1 phosphatase, and a non-catalytic subunit, E3 binding protein (E3BP). This gene encodes the E3 binding protein subunit; also known as component X of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. This protein tethers E3 dimers to the E2 core of the PDH complex. Defects in this gene are a cause of pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency which results in neurological dysfunction and lactic acidosis in infancy and early childhood. This protein is also a minor antigen for antimitochondrial antibodies. These autoantibodies are present in nearly 95% of patients with the autoimmune liver disease primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). In PBC, activated T lymphocytes attack and destroy epithelial cells in the bile duct where this protein is abnormally distributed and overexpressed. PBC eventually leads to cirrhosis and liver failure. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
The pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial multienzyme complex that catalyzes the overall conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and carbon dioxide, and provides the primary link between glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The PDH complex is composed of multiple copies of three enzymatic components: pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1), dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (E2) and lipoamide dehydrogenase (E3). The E1 enzyme is a heterotetramer of two alpha and two beta subunits. This gene encodes the E1 beta subunit. Mutations in this gene are associated with pyruvate dehydrogenase E1-beta deficiency. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the G-protein coupled receptor 2 family. This protein is a receptor for parathyroid hormone (PTH). This receptor is more selective in ligand recognition and has a more specific tissue distribution compared to parathyroid hormone receptor 1 (PTHR1). It is activated only by PTH and not by parathyroid hormone-like hormone (PTHLH) and is particularly abundant in brain and pancreas. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the protocadherin alpha gene cluster, one of three related gene clusters tandemly linked on chromosome five that demonstrate an unusual genomic organization similar to that of B-cell and T-cell receptor gene clusters. The alpha gene cluster is composed of 15 cadherin superfamily genes related to the mouse CNR genes and consists of 13 highly similar and 2 more distantly related coding sequences. The tandem array of 15 N-terminal exons, or variable exons, are followed by downstream C-terminal exons, or constant exons, which are shared by all genes in the cluster. The large, uninterrupted N-terminal exons each encode six cadherin ectodomains while the C-terminal exons encode the cytoplasmic domain. These neural cadherin-like cell adhesion proteins are integral plasma membrane proteins that most likely play a critical role in the establishment and function of specific cell-cell connections in the brain. Alternative splicing has been observed and additional variants have been suggested but their full-length nature has yet to be determined.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene induces proliferation, migration, and fenestration (the formation of membrane discontinuities) in capillary endothelial cells derived from endocrine glands. It has little or no effect on a variety of other endothelial and non-endothelial cell types. Its expression is restricted to the steroidogenic glands (ovary, testis, adrenal, and placenta), is induced by hypoxia, and often complementary to the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), suggesting that these molecules function in a coordinated manner.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a zinc finger protein with histone methyltransferase activity that catalyzes histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) during meiotic prophase. This protein contains multiple domains, including a Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain, an SSX repression domain (SSXRD), a PRD1-BF1 and RIZ homologous region, a subclass of SET (PR/SET) domain, and a tandem array of C2H2 zinc fingers. The zinc finger array recognizes a short sequence motif, leading to local H3K4me3, and meiotic recombination hotspot activity. The observed allelic variation alters the DNA-binding sequence specificity of the protein, resulting in distinct meiotic recombination hotspots amongst individuals and populations. Multiple alternate alleles of this gene have been described.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the P2X family of G-protein-coupled receptors. These proteins can form homo-and heterotimers and function as ATP-gated ion channels and mediate rapid and selective permeability to cations. This protein is primarily localized to smooth muscle where binds ATP and mediates synaptic transmission between neurons and from neurons to smooth muscle and may being responsible for sympathetic vasoconstriction in small arteries, arterioles and vas deferens. Mouse studies suggest that this receptor is essential for normal male reproductive function. This protein may also be involved in promoting apoptosis.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the P2X purinergic receptor (purinoceptor) gene family which includes seven members (P2RX1 - P2RX7). P2X purinoceptors are a family of cation-permeable, ligand-gated ion channels that open in response to the binding of extracellular adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP). The encoded protein is a subunit of the trimeric P2X3 receptor ion channel which is expressed by sensory or autonomic neurons. A deficiency of the orthologous protein in mice is associated with reduced pain-related behavior and urinary bladder hyporeflexia.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene belongs to the peroxin-26 gene family. It is probably required for protein import into peroxisomes. It anchors PEX1 and PEX6 to peroxisome membranes, possibly to form heteromeric AAA ATPase complexes required for the import of proteins into peroxisomes. Defects in this gene are the cause of peroxisome biogenesis disorder complementation group 8 (PBD-CG8). PBD refers to a group of peroxisomal disorders arising from a failure of protein import into the peroxisomal membrane or matrix. The PBD group is comprised of four disorders: Zellweger syndrome (ZWS), neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD), infantile Refsum disease (IRD), and classical rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata (RCDP). Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been identified for this gene.","Variant counts

This gene belongs to the protocadherin gene family, a subfamily of the cadherin superfamily. The encoded protein consists of an extracellular domain containing 6 cadherin repeats, a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail that differs from those of the classical cadherins. The gene localizes to the region on chromosome 5 where the protocadherin gene clusters reside. The exon organization of this transcript is similar to that of the gene cluster transcripts, notably the first large exon, but no significant sequence homology exists. The function of this cellular adhesion protein is undetermined but mouse protocadherin 12 does not bind catenins and appears to have no affect on cell migration or growth.","Variant counts

Summary
The product of this gene belongs to the family of G-protein coupled receptors. This family has several receptor subtypes with different pharmacological selectivity, which overlaps in some cases, for various adenosine and uridine nucleotides. This receptor is coupled to the stimulation of the phosphoinositide and adenylyl cyclase pathways and behaves as a selective purinoceptor. Naturally occuring read-through transcripts, resulting from intergenic splicing between this gene and an immediately upstream gene (PPAN, encoding peter pan homolog), have been found. The PPAN-P2RY11 read-through mRNA is ubiquitously expressed and encodes a fusion protein that shares identity with each individual gene product.","Variant counts

Subfamily A contains 12 genes, subfamily B contains 7 genes and 2 pseudogenes, and the more distantly related subfamily C contains 3 genes. The tandem array of 22 large, variable region exons are followed by a constant region, containing 3 exons shared by all genes in the cluster. Each variable region exon encodes the extracellular region, which includes 6 cadherin ectodomains and a transmembrane region. The constant region exons encode the common cytoplasmic region. These neural cadherin-like cell adhesion proteins most likely play a critical role in the establishment and function of specific cell-cell connections in the brain.

Summary
This gene is a member of the protocadherin gamma gene cluster, one of three related clusters tandemly linked on chromosome five. These gene clusters have an immunoglobulin-like organization, suggesting that a novel mechanism may be involved in their regulation and expression. The gamma gene cluster includes 22 genes divided into 3 subfamilies. Subfamily A contains 12 genes, subfamily B contains 7 genes and 2 pseudogenes, and the more distantly related subfamily C contains 3 genes. The tandem array of 22 large, variable region exons are followed by a constant region, containing 3 exons shared by all genes in the cluster. Each variable region exon encodes the extracellular region, which includes 6 cadherin ectodomains and a transmembrane region. The constant region exons encode the common cytoplasmic region. These neural cadherin-like cell adhesion proteins most likely play a critical role in the establishment and function of specific cell-cell connections in the brain.

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a histone lysine demethylase that preferentially acts on histones in the monomethyl or dimethyl states. The encoded protein requires Fe(2+) ion, 2-oxoglutarate, and oxygen for its catalytic activity. The protein has an N-terminal PHD finger and a central Jumonji C domain. This gene is thought to function as a transcription activator. Defects in this gene are a cause of syndromic X-linked Siderius type intellectual disability (MRXSSD) and over-expression of this gene is associated with several forms of cancer. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the plant homeodomain (PHD)-like finger (PHF) family. It encodes a protein with two PHD-type zinc finger domains, indicating a potential role in transcriptional regulation, that localizes to the nucleolus. Mutations affecting the coding region of this gene or the splicing of the transcript have been associated with Borjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome (BFLS), a disorder characterized by cognitive disability, epilepsy, hypogonadism, hypometabolism, obesity, swelling of subcutaneous tissue of the face, narrow palpebral fissures, and large ears. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants, encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
Spermatogenesis is a complex process regulated by extracellular and intracellular factors as well as cellular interactions among interstitial cells of the testis, Sertoli cells, and germ cells. This gene is expressed in the testis in Sertoli cells but not germ cells. The protein encoded by this gene contains plant homeodomain (PHD) finger domains, also known as leukemia associated protein (LAP) domains, believed to be involved in transcriptional regulation. The protein, which localizes to the nucleus of transfected cells, has been implicated in the transcriptional regulation of spermatogenesis. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants of this gene.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene is an enzyme that elongates the prenyl side-chain of coenzyme Q, or ubiquinone, one of the key elements in the respiratory chain. The gene product catalyzes the formation of all trans-polyprenyl pyrophosphates from isopentyl diphosphate in the assembly of polyisoprenoid side chains, the first step in coenzyme Q biosynthesis. The protein may be peripherally associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane, though no transit peptide has been definitively identified to date. Defects in this gene are a cause of coenzyme Q10 deficiency.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the phosphatidylethanolamine-binding family of proteins and has been shown to modulate multiple signaling pathways, including the MAP kinase (MAPK), NF-kappa B, and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) signaling pathways. The encoded protein can be further processed to form a smaller cleavage product, hippocampal cholinergic neurostimulating peptide (HCNP), which may be involved in neural development. This gene has been implicated in numerous human cancers and may act as a metastasis suppressor gene. Multiple pseudogenes of this gene have been identified in the genome.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 1,3-diphosphoglycerate to 3-phosphoglycerate. The encoded protein may also act as a cofactor for polymerase alpha. Additionally, this protein is secreted by tumor cells where it participates in angiogenesis by functioning to reduce disulfide bonds in the serine protease, plasmin, which consequently leads to the release of the tumor blood vessel inhibitor angiostatin. The encoded protein has been identified as a moonlighting protein based on its ability to perform mechanistically distinct functions. Deficiency of the enzyme is associated with a wide range of clinical phenotypes hemolytic anemia and neurological impairment. Pseudogenes of this gene have been defined on chromosomes 19, 21 and the X chromosome.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a mitochondrial protein with two putative domains, an N-terminal mitochondrial localization sequence, and a UPF0099 domain. In vitro assays suggest that this protein possesses peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase activity, to release the peptidyl moiety from tRNA, thereby preventing the accumulation of dissociated peptidyl-tRNA that could reduce the efficiency of translation. This protein also plays a role regulating cell survival and death. It promotes survival as part of an integrin-signaling pathway for cells attached to the extracellular matrix (ECM), but also promotes apoptosis in cells that have lost their attachment to the ECM, a process called anoikos. After loss of cell attachment to the ECM, this protein is phosphorylated, is released from the mitochondria into the cytosol, and promotes caspase-independent apoptosis through interactions with transcriptional regulators. This gene has been implicated in the development and progression of tumors, and mutations in this gene have been associated with an infantile multisystem neurologic, endocrine, and pancreatic disease (INMEPD) characterized by intellectual disability, postnatal microcephaly, progressive cerebellar atrophy, hearing impairment, polyneuropathy, failure to thrive, and organ fibrosis with exocrine pancreas insufficiency (PMID: 25574476). Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

GPI is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum and serves as an anchor for many surface proteins. Proteins containing GPI anchors can have an important role in cell-cell interactions. The transcript for this gene is bicistronic. The downstream open reading frame encodes this GPI-GnT complex protein, while the upstream open reading frame encodes a protein with unknown function, as represented by GeneID:100996939.","Variant counts
The variants found in rare patients tested by 3billion are classified and counted according to ACMG guidelines. The variants with over 5% variant frequency in population genome databases ( gnomAD, dbSNP, etc) are excluded.

Summary
This gene encodes a small essential subunit of RNA polymerase III, the polymerase responsible for synthesizing transfer and small ribosomal RNAs in eukaryotes. The carboxy-terminal domain of this subunit shares a high degree of sequence similarity to the carboxy-terminal domain of an RNA polymerase II elongation factor. This similarity in sequence is supported by functional studies showing that this subunit is required for proper pausing and termination during transcription. Pseudogenes of this gene are found on chromosomes 13 and 17.","Variant counts

Summary
Protamines substitute for histones in the chromatin of sperm during the haploid phase of spermatogenesis, and are the major DNA-binding proteins in the nucleus of sperm in many vertebrates. They package the sperm DNA into a highly condensed complex in a volume less than 5% of a somatic cell nucleus. Many mammalian species have only one protamine (protamine 1); however, a few species, including human and mouse, have two. This gene encodes protamine 2, which is cleaved to give rise to a family of protamine 2 peptides. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have also been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that is a component of the pancreas transcription factor 1 complex (PTF1) and is known to have a role in mammalian pancreatic development. The protein plays a role in determining whether cells allocated to the pancreatic buds continue towards pancreatic organogenesis or revert back to duodenal fates. The protein is thought to be involved in the maintenance of exocrine pancreas-specific gene expression including elastase 1 and amylase. Mutations in this gene cause cerebellar agenesis and loss of expression is seen in ductal type pancreas cancers.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase related to the dual specific mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) family. Evidence suggests that mitotic phosphorylation is required for its catalytic activity. The encoded protein may be involved in the activation of lymphoid cells and support testicular functions, with a suggested role in the process of spermatogenesis. Overexpression of this gene has been implicated in tumorigenesis. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene belongs to the multigene protein kinase D family of serine/threonine kinases, which bind diacylglycerol and phorbol esters. Members of this family are characterized by an N-terminal regulatory domain comprised of a tandem repeat of cysteine-rich zinc-finger motifs and a pleckstrin domain. The C-terminal region contains the catalytic domain and is distantly related to calcium-regulated kinases. Catalytic activity of this enzyme promotes its nuclear localization. This protein has been implicated in a variety of functions including negative regulation of human airway epithelial barrier formation, growth regulation of breast and prostate cancer cells, and vesicle trafficking.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the neuropeptide Y (NPY) family of peptides. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate two alternative peptide products that differ in length by three amino acids. These peptides, secreted by endocrine cells in the gut, exhibit different binding affinities for each of the neuropeptide Y receptors. Binding of the encoded peptides to these receptors mediates regulation of pancreatic secretion, gut mobility and energy homeostasis. Rare variations in this gene could increase susceptibility to obesity and elevated serum levels of the encoded peptides may be associated with anorexia nervosa.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes. The cytochrome P450 proteins are monooxygenases which catalyze many reactions involved in drug metabolism and synthesis of cholesterol, steroids and other lipids. However, this protein is considered a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily on the basis of sequence similarity rather than functional similarity. This endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein catalyzes the conversion of prostglandin H2 to prostacyclin (prostaglandin I2), a potent vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation. An imbalance of prostacyclin and its physiological antagonist thromboxane A2 contribute to the development of myocardial infarction, stroke, and atherosclerosis.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a member of the peptidase S1 or chymotrypsin family of serine proteases. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate light and heavy chains that associate via a disulfide bond to form the heterodimeric enzyme. This enzyme is highly expressed in prostate epithelia and is one of several proteolytic enzymes found in seminal fluid. This protease exhibits trypsin-like substrate specificity, cleaving protein substrates at the carboxyl terminus of lysine or arginine residues. The encoded protease partially mediates proteolytic activation of the epithelial sodium channel, a regulator of sodium balance, and may also play a role in epithelial barrier formation.","Variant counts

Summary
The 26S proteasome is a multicatalytic proteinase complex with a highly ordered structure composed of 2 complexes, a 20S core and a 19S regulator. The 20S core is composed of 4 rings of 28 non-identical subunits; 2 rings are composed of 7 alpha subunits and 2 rings are composed of 7 beta subunits. The 19S regulator is composed of a base, which contains 6 ATPase subunits and 2 non-ATPase subunits, and a lid, which contains up to 10 non-ATPase subunits. Proteasomes are distributed throughout eukaryotic cells at a high concentration and cleave peptides in an ATP/ubiquitin-dependent process in a non-lysosomal pathway. An essential function of a modified proteasome, the immunoproteasome, is the processing of class I MHC peptides. This gene encodes a non-ATPase subunit of the 19S regulator. A pseudogene has been identified on chromosome 1.","Variant counts

An essential function of a modified proteasome, the immunoproteasome, is the processing of class I MHC peptides. This gene encodes the largest non-ATPase subunit of the 19S regulator lid, which is responsible for substrate recognition and binding. There is evidence that this proteasome and its subunits interact with viral proteins, including those of coronaviruses. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Premature ovarian failure (POF) is characterized by primary or secondary amenorrhea in women less than 40 years old. Two POF susceptibility regions called 'POF1' and 'POF2' have been identified by breakpoint mapping of X-autosome translocations. POF1 extends from Xq21-qter while POF2 extends from Xq13.3 to Xq21.1. This gene, POF1B, resides in the POF2 region. This gene is expressed at trace levels in mouse prenatal ovary and is barely detectable or absent from adult ovary, in human and in the mouse respectively. This gene's expression is restricted to epithelia with its highest expression in the epidermis, and oro-pharyngeal and gastro-intestinal tracts. The protein encoded by this gene binds non-muscle actin filaments. The role this gene may play in the etiology of premature ovarian failure remains to be determined.","Variant counts

Summary
Phosphorylase kinase is a polymer of 16 subunits, four each of alpha, beta, gamma and delta. The alpha subunit includes the skeletal muscle and hepatic isoforms, encoded by two different genes. The beta subunit is the same in both the muscle and hepatic isoforms, encoded by this gene, which is a member of the phosphorylase b kinase regulatory subunit family. The gamma subunit also includes the skeletal muscle and hepatic isoforms, encoded by two different genes. The delta subunit is a calmodulin and can be encoded by three different genes. The gamma subunits contain the active site of the enzyme, whereas the alpha and beta subunits have regulatory functions controlled by phosphorylation. The delta subunit mediates the dependence of the enzyme on calcium concentration. Mutations in this gene cause glycogen storage disease type 9B, also known as phosphorylase kinase deficiency of liver and muscle. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified in this gene. Two pseudogenes have been found on chromosomes 14 and 20, respectively.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3)-dependent Rac exchanger (PREX) family, which are Dbl-type guanine-nucleotide exchange factors for Rac family small G proteins. Structural domains of this protein include the catalytic diffuse B-cell lymphoma homology and pleckstrin homology (DHPH) domain, two disheveled, EGL-10, and pleckstrin homology (DEP) domains, two PDZ domains, and a C-terminal inositol polyphosphate-4 phosphatase (IP4P) domain that is found in one of the isoforms. This protein facilitates the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rac1, allowing the GTP-bound Rac1 to activate downstream effectors. Studies also show that the pleckstrin homology domain of this protein interacts with the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) gene product to inhibit PTEN phosphatase activity, thus activating the phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway. Conversely, the PTEN gene product has also been shown to inhibit the GEF activity of this protein. This gene plays a role in insulin-signaling pathways, and either mutations or overexpression of this gene have been observed in some cancers.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a secreted serine protease that converts plasminogen to plasmin. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate A and B polypeptide chains. These chains associate via a single disulfide bond to form the catalytically inactive high molecular weight urokinase-type plasminogen activator (HMW-uPA). HMW-uPA can be further processed into the catalytically active low molecular weight urokinase-type plasminogen activator (LMW-uPA). This low molecular weight form does not bind to the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor. Mutations in this gene may be associated with Quebec platelet disorder and late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, at least one of which encodes an isoform that is proteolytically processed.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes tissue-type plasminogen activator, a secreted serine protease that converts the proenzyme plasminogen to plasmin, a fibrinolytic enzyme. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed by plasmin or trypsin to generate heavy and light chains. These chains associate via disulfide linkages to form the heterodimeric enzyme. This enzyme plays a role in cell migration and tissue remodeling. Increased enzymatic activity causes hyperfibrinolysis, which manifests as excessive bleeding, while decreased activity leads to hypofibrinolysis, which can result in thrombosis or embolism. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants, at least one of which encodes an isoform that is proteolytically processed.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the polycystin protein family. The encoded protein is a multi-pass membrane protein that functions as a calcium permeable cation channel, and is involved in calcium transport and calcium signaling in renal epithelial cells. This protein interacts with polycystin 1, and they may be partners in a common signaling cascade involved in tubular morphogenesis. Mutations in this gene are associated with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease type 2.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the polycystin protein family. The encoded glycoprotein contains a large N-terminal extracellular region, multiple transmembrane domains and a cytoplasmic C-tail. It is an integral membrane protein that functions as a regulator of calcium permeable cation channels and intracellular calcium homoeostasis. It is also involved in cell-cell/matrix interactions and may modulate G-protein-coupled signal-transduction pathways. It plays a role in renal tubular development, and mutations in this gene cause autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease type 1 (ADPKD1). ADPKD1 is characterized by the growth of fluid-filled cysts that replace normal renal tissue and result in end-stage renal failure. Splice variants encoding different isoforms have been noted for this gene. Also, six pseudogenes, closely linked in a known duplicated region on chromosome 16p, have been described.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the protocadherin gamma gene cluster, one of three related clusters tandemly linked on chromosome five. These gene clusters have an immunoglobulin-like organization, suggesting that a novel mechanism may be involved in their regulation and expression. The gamma gene cluster includes 22 genes divided into 3 subfamilies. Subfamily A contains 12 genes, subfamily B contains 7 genes and 2 pseudogenes, and the more distantly related subfamily C contains 3 genes. The tandem array of 22 large, variable region exons are followed by a constant region, containing 3 exons shared by all genes in the cluster. Each variable region exon encodes the extracellular region, which includes 6 cadherin ectodomains and a transmembrane region. The constant region exons encode the common cytoplasmic region. These neural cadherin-like cell adhesion proteins most likely play a critical role in the establishment and function of specific cell-cell connections in the brain. Alternative splicing has been described for the gamma cluster genes.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a homolog of the Drosophila polyhomeotic gene, which is a member of the Polycomb group of genes. The gene product is a component of a multimeric protein complex that contains EDR2 and the vertebrate Polycomb protein BMH1. The gene product, the EDR2 protein, and the Drosophila polyhomeotic protein share 2 highly conserved domains, named homology domains I and II. These domains are involved in protein-protein interactions and may mediate heterodimerization of the protein encoded by this gene and the EDR2 protein.","Variant counts

Summary
In Drosophila melanogaster, the 'Polycomb' group (PcG) of genes are part of a cellular memory system that is responsible for the stable inheritance of gene activity. PcG proteins form a large multimeric, chromatin-associated protein complex. The protein encoded by this gene has homology to the Drosophila PcG protein 'polyhomeotic' (Ph) and is known to heterodimerize with EDR1 and colocalize with BMI1 in interphase nuclei of human cells. The specific function in human cells has not yet been determined. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein with structural similarities to complement component C9 that is important in immunity. This protein forms membrane pores that allow the release of granzymes and subsequent cytolysis of target cells. Whether pore formation occurs in the plasma membrane of target cells or in an endosomal membrane inside target cells is subject to debate. Mutations in this gene are associated with a variety of human disease including diabetes, multiple sclerosis, lymphomas, autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS), aplastic anemia, and familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis type 2 (FHL2), a rare and lethal autosomal recessive disorder of early childhood.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes an adaptor protein that is composed of two protein-protein interaction domains: a N-terminal PYRIN-PAAD-DAPIN domain (PYD) and a C-terminal caspase-recruitment domain (CARD). The PYD and CARD domains are members of the six-helix bundle death domain-fold superfamily that mediates assembly of large signaling complexes in the inflammatory and apoptotic signaling pathways via the activation of caspase. In normal cells, this protein is localized to the cytoplasm; however, in cells undergoing apoptosis, it forms ball-like aggregates near the nuclear periphery. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the HIN-200 family of interferon-inducible proteins that share a 200-amino acid signature motif at their C-termini. HIN200 proteins are primarily nuclear and are involved in transcriptional regulation of genes important for cell cycle control, differentiation, and apoptosis. Downregulation of this gene is associated with breast cancer. This protein acts as a tumor suppressor by promoting ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of MDM2, which leads to stabilization of p53/TP53. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes an endoplasmic reticulum membrane oxidoreductase that is essential for multiple metabolic processes, including reactions catalyzed by cytochrome P450 proteins for metabolism of steroid hormones, drugs and xenobiotics. The encoded protein has a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-binding domain and a flavodoxin-like domain which bind two cofactors, FAD and FMN, that allow it to donate electrons directly from NADPH to all microsomal P450 enzymes. Mutations in this gene cause a complex set of disorders, including apparent combined P450C17 and P450C21 deficiency, amenorrhea and disordered steroidogenesis, congenital adrenal hyperplasia and Antley-Bixler syndrome, that resemble those caused by defects in steroid metabolizing enzymes such as aromatase, 21-hydroxylase, and 17 alpha-hydroxylase.","Variant counts

Summary
The product of this gene belongs to the family of purinoceptors for ATP. This receptor functions as a ligand-gated ion channel and is responsible for ATP-dependent lysis of macrophages through the formation of membrane pores permeable to large molecules. Activation of this nuclear receptor by ATP in the cytoplasm may be a mechanism by which cellular activity can be coupled to changes in gene expression. Multiple alternatively spliced variants have been identified, most of which fit nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) criteria.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a highly conserved preproprotein that is proteolytically processed to generate four main cleavage products including saposins A, B, C, and D. Each domain of the precursor protein is approximately 80 amino acid residues long with nearly identical placement of cysteine residues and glycosylation sites. Saposins A-D localize primarily to the lysosomal compartment where they facilitate the catabolism of glycosphingolipids with short oligosaccharide groups. The precursor protein exists both as a secretory protein and as an integral membrane protein and has neurotrophic activities. Mutations in this gene have been associated with Gaucher disease and metachromatic leukodystrophy. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, at least one of which encodes an isoform that is proteolytically processed.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the cytosolic phospholipase A2 group IV family. The enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids to release arachidonic acid which is subsequently metabolized into eicosanoids. Eicosanoids, including prostaglandins and leukotrienes, are lipid-based cellular hormones that regulate hemodynamics, inflammatory responses, and other intracellular pathways. The hydrolysis reaction also produces lysophospholipids that are converted into platelet-activating factor. The enzyme is activated by increased intracellular Ca(2+) levels and phosphorylation, resulting in its translocation from the cytosol and nucleus to perinuclear membrane vesicles. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

The proteasome is a multicatalytic proteinase complex with a highly ordered ring-shaped 20S core structure. The core structure is composed of 4 rings of 28 non-identical subunits; 2 rings are composed of 7 alpha subunits and 2 rings are composed of 7 beta subunits. Proteasomes are distributed throughout eukaryotic cells at a high concentration and cleave peptides in an ATP/ubiquitin-dependent process in a non-lysosomal pathway. An essential function of a modified proteasome, the immunoproteasome, is the processing of class I MHC peptides. This gene encodes a member of the peptidase T1A family, that is a 20S core alpha subunit. Two alternative transcripts encoding different isoforms have been identified.","Variant counts

Summary
Programmed cell death protein 1 (PDCD1) is an immune-inhibitory receptor expressed in activated T cells; it is involved in the regulation of T-cell functions, including those of effector CD8+ T cells. In addition, this protein can also promote the differentiation of CD4+ T cells into T regulatory cells. PDCD1 is expressed in many types of tumors including melanomas, and has demonstrated to play a role in anti-tumor immunity. Moreover, this protein has been shown to be involved in safeguarding against autoimmunity, however, it can also contribute to the inhibition of effective anti-tumor and anti-microbial immunity.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes an evolutionarily conserved protein associated with cell apoptosis. The protein interacts with the serine/threonine protein kinase MST4 to modulate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. It also interacts with and is phosphoryated by serine/threonine kinase 25, and is thought to function in a signaling pathway essential for vascular developent. Mutations in this gene are one cause of cerebral cavernous malformations, which are vascular malformations that cause seizures and cerebral hemorrhages. Multiple alternatively spliced variants, encoding the same protein, have been identified.","Variant counts
The variants found in rare patients tested by 3billion are classified and counted according to ACMG guidelines. The variants with over 5% variant frequency in population genome databases ( gnomAD, dbSNP, etc) are excluded.

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a membrane glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoprotein that tends to aggregate into rod-like structures. The encoded protein contains a highly unstable region of five tandem octapeptide repeats. This gene is found on chromosome 20, approximately 20 kbp upstream of a gene which encodes a biochemically and structurally similar protein to the one encoded by this gene. Mutations in the repeat region as well as elsewhere in this gene have been associated with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, fatal familial insomnia, Gerstmann-Straussler disease, Huntington disease-like 1, and kuru. An overlapping open reading frame has been found for this gene that encodes a smaller, structurally unrelated protein, AltPrp. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
Mammals have three different isoforms of cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase (Ialpha, Ibeta, and II). These PRKG isoforms act as key mediators of the nitric oxide/cGMP signaling pathway and are important components of many signal transduction processes in diverse cell types. This PRKG1 gene on human chromosome 10 encodes the soluble Ialpha and Ibeta isoforms of PRKG by alternative transcript splicing. A separate gene on human chromosome 4, PRKG2, encodes the membrane-bound PRKG isoform II. The PRKG1 proteins play a central role in regulating cardiovascular and neuronal functions in addition to relaxing smooth muscle tone, preventing platelet aggregation, and modulating cell growth. This gene is most strongly expressed in all types of smooth muscle, platelets, cerebellar Purkinje cells, hippocampal neurons, and the lateral amygdala. Isoforms Ialpha and Ibeta have identical cGMP-binding and catalytic domains but differ in their leucine/isoleucine zipper and autoinhibitory sequences and therefore differ in their dimerization substrates and kinase enzyme activity.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that belongs to the serine/threonine protein kinase family of proteins. The encoded protein binds to and inhibits the activation of several receptor tyrosine kinases. The membrane-bound protein is a regulator of intestinal secretion, bone growth and renin secretion. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms whose regulatory N-termini differ in length but whose C-terminal catalytic domains are identical.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a cell surface tyrosine kinase receptor for members of the platelet-derived growth factor family. These growth factors are mitogens for cells of mesenchymal origin. The identity of the growth factor bound to a receptor monomer determines whether the functional receptor is a homodimer (PDGFB or PDGFD) or a heterodimer (PDGFA and PDGFB). This gene is essential for normal development of the cardiovascular system and aids in rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton. This gene is flanked on chromosome 5 by the genes for granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and macrophage-colony stimulating factor receptor; all three genes may be implicated in the 5-q syndrome. A translocation between chromosomes 5 and 12, that fuses this gene to that of the ETV6 gene, results in chronic myeloproliferative disorder with eosinophilia.","Variant counts

This protein may function as an adaptor that binds to and organizes the subcellular localization of a variety of membrane proteins. It has been shown to interact with multiple glutamate receptor subtypes, monoamine plasma membrane transporters, as well as non-voltage gated sodium channels, and may target PRKCA to these membrane proteins and thus regulate their distribution and function. This protein has also been found to act as an anchoring protein that specifically targets PRKCA to mitochondria in a ligand-specific manner. Three transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a nucleolar protein that localizes to punctate subnuclear structures that occur close to splicing speckles, known as paraspeckles. These paraspeckles are composed of RNA-protein structures that include a non-coding RNA, NEAT1/Men epsilon/beta, and the Drosophila Behavior Human Splicing family of proteins, which include the product of this gene and the P54NRB/NONO and PSF/SFPQ proteins. Paraspeckles may function in the control of gene expression via an RNA nuclear retention mechanism. The protein encoded by this gene is found in paraspeckles in transcriptionally active cells, but it localizes to unique cap structures at the nucleolar periphery when RNA polymerase II transcription is inhibited, or during telophase. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants. A related pseudogene, which is also located on chromosome 13, has been identified.","Variant counts

Summary
Proteasomes generate peptides that are presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I molecules to other cells of the immune system. Proteolysis is conducted by 20S proteasomes, complexes of 28 subunits arranged as a cylinder in 4 heteroheptameric rings: alpha-1 to -7, beta-1 to -7, beta-1 to -7, and alpha-1 to -7. The catalytic subunits are beta-1 (PSMB6; MIM 600307), beta-2 (PSMB7; MIM 604030), and beta-5 (PSMB5; MIM 600306). Three additional subunits, beta-1i (PSMB9; MIM 177045), beta-2i (PSMB10; MIM 176847), and beta-5i (PSMB8; MIM 177046), are induced by gamma-interferon (IFNG; MIM 147570) and are preferentially incorporated into proteasomes to make immunoproteasomes. PSMB11, or beta-5t, is a catalytic subunit expressed exclusively in cortical thymic epithelial cells (Murata et al., 2007 [PubMed 17540904]).","Variant counts

Summary
The proteasome is a multicatalytic proteinase complex with a highly ordered ring-shaped 20S core structure. The core structure is composed of 4 rings of 28 non-identical subunits; 2 rings are composed of 7 alpha subunits and 2 rings are composed of 7 beta subunits. Proteasomes are distributed throughout eukaryotic cells at a high concentration and cleave peptides in an ATP/ubiquitin-dependent process in a non-lysosomal pathway. An essential function of a modified proteasome, the immunoproteasome, is the processing of class I MHC peptides. This gene encodes a member of the proteasome B-type family, also known as the T1B family, that is a 20S core beta subunit. Proteolytic processing is required to generate a mature subunit. Expression of this gene is induced by gamma interferon, and this gene product replaces catalytic subunit 2 (proteasome beta 7 subunit) in the immunoproteasome.","Variant counts

Summary
The DNA-associated protein encoded by this gene is a member of the paired family of homeobox proteins. Expression is localized to proliferating fetal fibroblasts and the developing dermal layer, with downregulated expression in adult skin. Increases in expression of this gene during fetal but not adult wound healing suggest a possible role in mechanisms that control mammalian dermal regeneration and prevent formation of scar response to wounding. The expression patterns provide evidence consistent with a role in fetal skin development and a possible role in cellular proliferation.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a 3'-exoribonuclease, with similarity to the RNase D family of 3'-exonucleases. It prefers poly(A) as the substrate, hence, efficiently degrades poly(A) tails of mRNAs. Exonucleolytic degradation of the poly(A) tail is often the first step in the decay of eukaryotic mRNAs. This protein is also involved in silencing of certain maternal mRNAs during oocyte maturation and early embryonic development, as well as in nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) of mRNAs that contain premature stop codons. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a membrane-bound homodimeric enzyme that is localized to the cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The enzyme (cofactors iron and ascorbate) catalyzes the hydroxylation of lysyl residues in collagen-like peptides. The resultant hydroxylysyl groups are attachment sites for carbohydrates in collagen and thus are critical for the stability of intermolecular crosslinks. Some patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIB have deficiencies in lysyl hydroxylase activity. Mutations in the coding region of this gene are associated with Bruck syndrome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a secreted metalloproteinase which cleaves insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs). Following IGFBP cleavage, insulin growth factors dissociate from IGFBPs and bind to IGF receptors, resulting in activation of the IGF pathway. The encoded protein plays a role in bone formation, inflammation, wound healing and female fertility. Enhanced expression of this protein is associated with diabetic nephropathy in human patients and this protein may promote tumor invasion and growth in various human cancers.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) family. PI3-kinases play roles in signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation, oncogenic transformation, cell survival, cell migration, and intracellular protein trafficking. This protein contains a lipid kinase catalytic domain as well as a C-terminal C2 domain, a characteristic of class II PI3-kinases. C2 domains act as calcium-dependent phospholipid binding motifs that mediate translocation of proteins to membranes, and may also mediate protein-protein interactions. The PI3-kinase activity of this protein is sensitive to low nanomolar levels of the inhibitor wortmanin. The C2 domain of this protein was shown to bind phospholipids but not Ca2+, which suggests that this enzyme may function in a calcium-independent manner.","Variant counts

Summary
This locus was identified as encoding a gene that when mutated or lost caused the lissencephaly associated with Miller-Dieker lissencephaly syndrome. This gene encodes the non-catalytic alpha subunit of the intracellular Ib isoform of platelet-activating factor acteylhydrolase, a heterotrimeric enzyme that specifically catalyzes the removal of the acetyl group at the SN-2 position of platelet-activating factor (identified as 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glyceryl-3-phosphorylcholine). Two other isoforms of intracellular platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase exist: one composed of multiple subunits, the other, a single subunit. In addition, a single-subunit isoform of this enzyme is found in serum.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the LAR protein-tyrosine phosphatase-interacting protein (liprin) family. Liprins interact with members of LAR family of transmembrane protein tyrosine phosphatases, which are known to be important for axon guidance and mammary gland development. It has been proposed that liprins are multivalent proteins that form complex structures and act as scaffolds for the recruitment and anchoring of LAR family of tyrosine phosphatases. This protein was found to interact with S100A4, a calcium-binding protein related to tumor invasiveness and metastasis. In vitro experiment demonstrated that the interaction inhibited the phosphorylation of this protein by protein kinase C and protein kinase CK2. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been reported.","Variant counts

Summary
Peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases (PPIases) catalyze the cis/trans isomerization of peptidyl-prolyl peptide bonds. This gene encodes one of the PPIases, which specifically binds to phosphorylated ser/thr-pro motifs to catalytically regulate the post-phosphorylation conformation of its substrates. The conformational regulation catalyzed by this PPIase has a profound impact on key proteins involved in the regulation of cell growth, genotoxic and other stress responses, the immune response, induction and maintenance of pluripotency, germ cell development, neuronal differentiation, and survival. This enzyme also plays a key role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and many cancers. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the PUF family, evolutionarily conserved RNA-binding proteins related to the Pumilio proteins of Drosophila and the fem-3 mRNA binding factor proteins of C. elegans. The encoded protein contains a sequence-specific RNA binding domain comprised of eight repeats and N- and C-terminal flanking regions, and serves as a translational regulator of specific mRNAs by binding to their 3' untranslated regions. The evolutionarily conserved function of the encoded protein in invertebrates and lower vertebrates suggests that the human protein may be involved in translational regulation of embryogenesis, and cell development and differentiation. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene contains an A-T hook DNA binding motif which usually binds to other DNA binding structures to play an important role in chromatin modeling and transcription regulation. Its Poz domain is thought to function as a site for protein-protein interaction and is required for transcriptional repression, and the zinc-fingers comprise the DNA binding domain. Since the encoded protein has typical features of a transcription factor, it is postulated to be a repressor of gene expression. In small round cell sarcoma, this gene is fused to EWS by a small inversion of 22q, then the hybrid is thought to be translocated (t(1;22)(p36.1;q12). The rearrangement of chromosome 22 involves intron 8 of EWS and exon 1 of this gene creating a chimeric sequence containing the transactivation domain of EWS fused to zinc finger domain of this protein. This is a distinct example of an intra-chromosomal rearrangement of chromosome 22. Four alternatively spliced transcript variants are described for this gene.","Variant counts

This gene encodes poly(ADP-ribosyl)transferase-like 1 protein, which is capable of catalyzing a poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation reaction. This protein has a catalytic domain which is homologous to that of poly (ADP-ribosyl) transferase, but lacks an N-terminal DNA binding domain which activates the C-terminal catalytic domain of poly (ADP-ribosyl) transferase. Since this protein is not capable of binding DNA directly, its transferase activity may be activated by other factors such as protein-protein interaction mediated by the extensive carboxyl terminus.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a component of desmosomes and of the epidermal cornified envelope in keratinocytes. The N-terminal domain of this protein interacts with the plasma membrane and its C-terminus interacts with intermediate filaments. Through its rod domain, this protein forms complexes with envoplakin. This protein may serve as a link between the cornified envelope and desmosomes as well as intermediate filaments. AKT1/PKB, a protein kinase mediating a variety of cell growth and survival signaling processes, is reported to interact with this protein, suggesting a possible role for this protein as a localization signal in AKT1-mediated signaling.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the neuropeptide Y (NPY) family of peptides. The encoded 95 aa preproprotein is synthesized in the pancreatic islets of Langerhans and proteolytically processed to generate two peptide products. These products include the active pancreatic hormone of 36 aa and an icosapeptide of unknown function. This hormone acts as a regulator of pancreatic and gastrointestinal functions and may be important in the regulation of food intake. Plasma level of this hormone has been shown to be reduced in conditions associated with increased food intake and elevated in anorexia nervosa. In addition, infusion of this hormone in obese rodents has shown to decrease weight gain. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, at least one of which encodes an isoform that is proteolytically processed.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene belongs to the subfamily of ubiquitously expressed heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs). The hnRNPs are RNA-binding proteins and they complex with heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA). These proteins are associated with pre-mRNAs in the nucleus and appear to influence pre-mRNA processing and other aspects of mRNA metabolism and transport. While all of the hnRNPs are present in the nucleus, some seem to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The hnRNP proteins have distinct nucleic acid binding properties. The protein encoded by this gene has four repeats of quasi-RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains that bind RNAs. This protein binds to the intronic polypyrimidine tracts that requires pre-mRNA splicing and acts via the protein degradation ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. It may also promote the binding of U2 snRNP to pre-mRNAs. This protein is localized in the nucleoplasm and it is also detected in the perinucleolar structure. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described.","Variant counts

Summary
Phosphoinositide 3-kinase gamma is a lipid kinase that produces the lipid second messenger phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate. The kinase is composed of a catalytic subunit and one of several regulatory subunits, and is chiefly activated by G protein-coupled receptors. This gene encodes a regulatory subunit, and is distantly related to the phosphoinositide-3-kinase, regulatory subunit 5 gene which is located adjacent to this gene on chromosome 7. The orthologous protein in the mouse binds to both the catalytic subunit and to G(beta/gamma), and mediates activation of the kinase subunit downstream of G protein-coupled receptors. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks) phosphorylate the inositol ring of phosphatidylinositol at the 3-prime position, and play important roles in cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, motility, survival and intracellular trafficking. The PI3Ks are divided into three classes: I, II and III, and only the class I PI3Ks are involved in oncogenesis. This gene encodes the 101 kD regulatory subunit of the class I PI3K gamma complex, which is a dimeric enzyme, consisting of a 110 kD catalytic subunit gamma and a regulatory subunit of either 55, 87 or 101 kD. This protein recruits the catalytic subunit from the cytosol to the plasma membrane through high-affinity interaction with G-beta-gamma proteins. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding two distinct isoforms have been found.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the platelet-derived growth factor family. The four members of this family are mitogenic factors for cells of mesenchymal origin and are characterized by a core motif of eight cysteines, seven of which are found in this factor. This gene product only forms homodimers and, therefore, does not dimerize with the other three family members. It differs from alpha and beta members of this family in having an unusual N-terminal domain, the CUB domain. Two splice variants have been identified for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
cAMP is a signaling molecule important for a variety of cellular functions. cAMP exerts its effects by activating the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, which transduces the signal through phosphorylation of different target proteins. The inactive kinase holoenzyme is a tetramer composed of two regulatory and two catalytic subunits. cAMP causes the dissociation of the inactive holoenzyme into a dimer of regulatory subunits bound to four cAMP and two free monomeric catalytic subunits. Four different regulatory subunits and three catalytic subunits have been identified in humans. This gene encodes one of the regulatory subunits. This protein was found to be a tissue-specific extinguisher that down-regulates the expression of seven liver genes in hepatoma x fibroblast hybrids. Mutations in this gene cause Carney complex (CNC). This gene can fuse to the RET protooncogene by gene rearrangement and form the thyroid tumor-specific chimeric oncogene known as PTC2. A nonconventional nuclear localization sequence (NLS) has been found for this protein which suggests a role in DNA replication via the protein serving as a nuclear transport protein for the second subunit of the Replication Factor C (RFC40). Several alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding two different isoforms have been observed.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is the founding member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family, which was isolated and identified based on its enzymatic activity and amino acid sequence. PTPs catalyze the hydrolysis of the phosphate monoesters specifically on tyrosine residues. Members of the PTP family share a highly conserved catalytic motif, which is essential for the catalytic activity. PTPs are known to be signaling molecules that regulate a variety of cellular processes including cell growth, differentiation, mitotic cycle, and oncogenic transformation. This PTP has been shown to act as a negative regulator of insulin signaling by dephosphorylating the phosphotryosine residues of insulin receptor kinase.

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family. PTPs are known to be signaling molecules that regulate a variety of cellular processes including cell growth, differentiation, mitotic cycle, and oncogenic transformation. This gene is preferentially expressed in a variety of hematopoietic cells, and is an early response gene in lymphokine stimulated cells. The non-catalytic N-terminus of this PTP can interact with MAP kinases and suppress the MAP kinase activities. This PTP was shown to be involved in the regulation of T cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling, which was thought to function through dephosphorylating the molecules related to MAP kinase pathway. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

This gene is a member of the telombin family and encodes a nuclear protein involved in telomere maintenance. Specifically, this protein functions as a member of a multi-protein complex that binds to the TTAGGG repeats of telomeres, regulating telomere length and protecting chromosome ends from illegitimate recombination, catastrophic chromosome instability, and abnormal chromosome segregation. Increased transcriptional expression of this gene is associated with stomach carcinogenesis and its progression. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a DNA-dependent adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-metabolizing enzyme that functions as a 5' to 3' DNA helicase. The encoded protein can resolve G-quadruplex structures and RNA-DNA hybrids at the ends of chromosomes. It also prevents telomere elongation by inhibiting the actions of telomerase. Alternative splicing and the use of alternative start codons results in multiple isoforms that are differentially localized to either the mitochondria or the nucleus.","Variant counts

Summary
Phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues in proteins is a crucial step in the regulation of many cellular functions ranging from hormonal regulation to cell division and even short-term memory. The level of phosphorylation is controlled by the opposing actions of protein kinases and protein phosphatases. Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) is 1 of 4 major serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatases which have been identified in eukaryotic cells. PP1 associates with various regulatory subunits that dictate its subcellular localization and modulate its substrate specificity. Several subunits that target PP1 to glycogen have been identified. This gene encodes a glycogen-targeting subunit of PP1.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a transcription factor containing a POU homeodomain that plays a key role in embryonic development and stem cell pluripotency. Aberrant expression of this gene in adult tissues is associated with tumorigenesis. This gene can participate in a translocation with the Ewing's sarcoma gene on chromosome 21, which also leads to tumor formation. Alternative splicing, as well as usage of alternative AUG and non-AUG translation initiation codons, results in multiple isoforms. One of the AUG start codons is polymorphic in human populations. Related pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes 1, 3, 8, 10, and 12.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a protein that is induced by the steroid hormone progesterone and plays a role in the maintenance of pregnancy. The encoded protein regulates multiple facets of the immune system to promote normal pregnancy including cytokine synthesis, natural killer (NK) cell activity, and arachidonic acid metabolism. Low serum levels of this protein have been associated with spontaneous pre-term labor in humans. This protein may promote the proliferation, migration and invasion of glioma.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a homodimeric protein that catalyses the cleavage of alpha-1,4-glucosidic bonds to release glucose-1-phosphate from liver glycogen stores. This protein switches from inactive phosphorylase B to active phosphorylase A by phosphorylation of serine residue 15. Activity of this enzyme is further regulated by multiple allosteric effectors and hormonal controls. Humans have three glycogen phosphorylase genes that encode distinct isozymes that are primarily expressed in liver, brain and muscle, respectively. The liver isozyme serves the glycemic demands of the body in general while the brain and muscle isozymes supply just those tissues. In glycogen storage disease type VI, also known as Hers disease, mutations in liver glycogen phosphorylase inhibit the conversion of glycogen to glucose and results in moderate hypoglycemia, mild ketosis, growth retardation and hepatomegaly. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
Myosin phosphatase target subunit 1, which is also called the myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase, is one of the subunits of myosin phosphatase. Myosin phosphatase regulates the interaction of actin and myosin downstream of the guanosine triphosphatase Rho. The small guanosine triphosphatase Rho is implicated in myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, which results in contraction of smooth muscle and interaction of actin and myosin in nonmuscle cells. The guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound, active form of RhoA (GTP.RhoA) specifically interacted with the myosin-binding subunit (MBS) of myosin phosphatase, which regulates the extent of phosphorylation of MLC. Rho-associated kinase (Rho-kinase), which is activated by GTP. RhoA, phosphorylated MBS and consequently inactivated myosin phosphatase. Overexpression of RhoA or activated RhoA in NIH 3T3 cells increased phosphorylation of MBS and MLC. Thus, Rho appears to inhibit myosin phosphatase through the action of Rho-kinase. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Myosin phosphatase is a protein complex comprised of three subunits: a catalytic subunit (PP1c-delta, protein phosphatase 1, catalytic subunit delta), a large regulatory subunit (MYPT, myosin phosphatase target) and small regulatory subunit (sm-M20). Two isoforms of MYPT have been isolated--MYPT1 and MYPT2, the first of which is widely expressed, and the second of which may be specific to heart, skeletal muscle, and brain. Each of the MYPT isoforms functions to bind PP1c-delta and increase phosphatase activity. This locus encodes both MYTP2 and M20. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified. Related pseudogenes have been defined on the Y chromosome.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a secreted member of the phospholipase A2 (PLA2) class of enzymes, which is produced by the pancreatic acinar cells. The encoded calcium-dependent enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of the sn-2 position of membrane glycerophospholipids to release arachidonic acid (AA) and lysophospholipids. AA is subsequently converted by downstream metabolic enzymes to several bioactive lipophilic compounds (eicosanoids), including prostaglandins (PGs) and leukotrienes (LTs). The enzyme may be involved in several physiological processes including cell contraction, cell proliferation and pathological response.","Variant counts

Summary
Lysophospholipases are enzymes that act on biological membranes to regulate the multifunctional lysophospholipids. The protein encoded by this gene hydrolyzes lysophosphatidylcholine to glycerophosphorylcholine and a free fatty acid. This enzyme is present in the plasma and thought to be associated with high-density lipoprotein. A later paper contradicts the function of this gene. It demonstrates that this gene encodes a lysosomal enzyme instead of a lysophospholipase and has both calcium-independent phospholipase A2 and transacylase activities.","Variant counts

Summary
Sulfation is a common modification of endogenous (lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates) and exogenous (xenobiotics and drugs) compounds. In mammals, the sulfate source is 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS), created from ATP and inorganic sulfate. Two different tissue isoforms encoded by different genes synthesize PAPS. This gene encodes one of the two PAPS synthetases. Defects in this gene cause the Pakistani type of spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia. Two alternatively spliced transcript variants that encode different isoforms have been described for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the DNA polymerase type-Y family of proteins. The encoded protein is a specialized DNA polymerase that catalyzes translesion DNA synthesis, which allows DNA replication in the presence of DNA lesions. Human cell lines lacking a functional copy of this gene exhibit impaired genome integrity and enhanced susceptibility to oxidative damage. Mutations in this gene that impair enzyme activity may be associated with prostate cancer in human patients.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is an error-prone DNA polymerase involved in DNA repair. The encoded protein promotes DNA synthesis across lesions in the template DNA, which other polymerases cannot do. The encoded polymerase inserts deoxynucleotides across lesions and then relies on DNA polymerase zeta to extend the nascent DNA strand to bypass the lesion.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the Y family of specialized DNA polymerases. It copies undamaged DNA with a lower fidelity than other DNA-directed polymerases. However, it accurately replicates UV-damaged DNA; when thymine dimers are present, this polymerase inserts the complementary nucleotides in the newly synthesized DNA, thereby bypassing the lesion and suppressing the mutagenic effect of UV-induced DNA damage. This polymerase is thought to be involved in hypermutation during immunoglobulin class switch recombination. Mutations in this gene result in XPV, a variant type of xeroderma pigmentosum. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that is involved in cytokinesis. The protein is present at high levels during the S and G2/M phases of mitosis but its levels drop dramatically when the cell exits mitosis and enters the G1 phase. It is located in the nucleus during interphase, becomes associated with mitotic spindles in a highly dynamic manner during mitosis, and localizes to the cell mid-body during cytokinesis. This protein has been shown to be a substrate of several cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). It is necessary for polarizing parallel microtubules and concentrating the factors responsible for contractile ring assembly. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the peptidase S28 family of serine exopeptidases. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate the mature lysosomal prolylcarboxypeptidase. This enzyme cleaves C-terminal amino acids linked to proline in peptides such as angiotension II, III and des-Arg9-bradykinin. The cleavage occurs at acidic pH, but the enzyme activity is retained with some substrates at neutral pH. This enzyme has been shown to be an activator of the cell matrix-associated prekallikrein. The importance of angiotension II, one of the substrates of this enzyme, in regulating blood pressure and electrolyte balance suggests that this gene may be related to essential hypertension. A pseudogene of this gene has been identified on chromosome 2. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, at least one of which encodes an isoform that is proteolytically processed.","Variant counts

Summary
Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with an inherited form of the disease carry mutations in the presenilin proteins (PSEN1 or PSEN2) or the amyloid precursor protein (APP). These disease-linked mutations result in increased production of the longer form of amyloid-beta (main component of amyloid deposits found in AD brains). Presenilins are postulated to regulate APP processing through their effects on gamma-secretase, an enzyme that cleaves APP. Also, it is thought that the presenilins are involved in the cleavage of the Notch receptor such that, they either directly regulate gamma-secretase activity, or themselves act are protease enzymes. Two alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms of PSEN2 have been identified.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a cytoskeletal protein that is highly expressed in hemopoietic tissues. This protein functions via its interaction with several different proteins involved in cytoskeletal organization and inflammatory processes. It binds to the cytoplasmic tail of CD2, an effector of T cell activation and adhesion, downregulating CD2-triggered adhesion. It binds PEST-type protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP) and directs them to c-Abl kinase to mediate c-Abl dephosphorylation, thereby, regulating c-Abl activity. It also interacts with pyrin, which is found in association with the cytoskeleton in myeloid/monocytic cells and modulates immunoregulatory functions. Mutations in this gene are associated with PAPA (pyogenic sterile arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne) syndrome. It is hypothesized that the disease-causing mutations compromise physiologic signaling necessary for the maintenance of a proper inflammatory response.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the histidine acid phosphatase family of proteins. Despite containing a histidine acid phosphatase domain, the encoded protein functions as an inositol pyrophosphate kinase, and is thought to lack phosphatase activity. This kinase activity is the mechanism by which the encoded protein synthesizes high-energy inositol pyrophosphates, which act as signaling molecules that regulate cellular homeostasis and other processes. This gene may be associated with autism spectrum disorder in human patients.","Variant counts

Summary
Plastins are a family of actin-binding proteins that are conserved throughout eukaryote evolution and expressed in most tissues of higher eukaryotes. In humans, two ubiquitous plastin isoforms (L and T) have been identified. Plastin 1 (otherwise known as Fimbrin) is a third distinct plastin isoform which is specifically expressed at high levels in the small intestine. The L isoform is expressed only in hemopoietic cell lineages, while the T isoform has been found in all other normal cells of solid tissues that have replicative potential (fibroblasts, endothelial cells, epithelial cells, melanocytes, etc.). The C-terminal 570 amino acids of the T-plastin and L-plastin proteins are 83% identical. It contains a potential calcium-binding site near the N terminus. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a member of the peroxiredoxin family of antioxidant enzymes, which reduce hydrogen peroxide and alkyl hydroperoxides. The encoded protein interacts with peroxisome receptor 1 and plays an antioxidant protective role in different tissues under normal conditions and during inflammatory processes. The use of alternate transcription start sites is thought to result in transcript variants that use different in-frame translational start codons to generate isoforms that are targeted to the mitochondrion (isoform L) or peroxisome/cytoplasm (isoform S). Multiple related pseudogenes have been defined for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene represents a phospholipase A2 receptor. The encoded protein likely exists as both a transmembrane form and a soluble form. The transmembrane receptor may play a role in clearance of phospholipase A2, thereby inhibiting its action. Polymorphisms at this locus have been associated with susceptibility to idiopathic membranous nephropathy. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the pregnancy-specific glycoprotein (PSG) family. This protein family and the closely related carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM) gene family are both members of the immunoglobulin superfamily, and are organized as a large gene cluster. This protein is thought to inhibit platelet-fibrinogen interactions. Several studies suggest that reduced serum concentrations of PSGs are associated with fetal growth restrictions, while up-regulation of this gene has been observed in colorectal cancers. Several pseudogenes of this gene are found on chromosome 19. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants that encode multiple protein isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the family of bifunctional 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase:fructose-2,6-biphosphatase enzymes. The enzyme forms a homodimer that catalyzes both the synthesis and degradation of fructose-2,6-biphosphate using independent catalytic domains. Fructose-2,6-biphosphate is an activator of the glycolysis pathway and an inhibitor of the gluconeogenesis pathway. Consequently, regulating fructose-2,6-biphosphate levels through the activity of this enzyme is thought to regulate glucose homeostasis. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

The encoded protein has a 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase activity that catalyzes the synthesis of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, and a fructose-2,6-biphosphatase activity that catalyzes the degradation of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate. This protein regulates fructose-2,6-bisphosphate levels in the heart, while a related enzyme encoded by a different gene regulates fructose-2,6-bisphosphate levels in the liver and muscle. This enzyme functions as a homodimer. Two transcript variants encoding two different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is one of four bifunctional kinase/phosphatases that regulate the concentration of the glycolytic byproduct fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F2,6BP). The encoded protein is highly expressed in cancer cells and is induced by hypoxia. This protein is essential to the survival of cancer cells under conditions of hypoxia, because it increases the amount of F2,6BP and ATP at a time when the cell cannot produce much of them. This finding suggests that this protein may be a good target for disruption in cancer cells, hopefully imperiling their survival. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a HEAT-like repeat-containing protein. The HEAT repeat is a tandemly repeated, 37-47 amino acid long module occurring in a number of cytoplasmic proteins. Arrays of HEAT repeats form a rod-like helical structure and appear to function as protein-protein interaction surfaces. The repeat-containing region of this protein has some similarity to the constant regulatory domain of the protein phosphatase 2A PR65/A subunit. The encoded protein binds protein serine/threonine phosphatase 4c in the cytoplasm.","Variant counts

Subfamily A contains 12 genes, subfamily B contains 7 genes and 2 pseudogenes, and the more distantly related subfamily C contains 3 genes. The tandem array of 22 large, variable region exons are followed by a constant region, containing 3 exons shared by all genes in the cluster. Each variable region exon encodes the extracellular region, which includes 6 cadherin ectodomains and a transmembrane region. The constant region exons encode the common cytoplasmic region. These neural cadherin-like cell adhesion proteins most likely play a critical role in the establishment and function of specific cell-cell connections in the brain. Alternative splicing has been described for the gamma cluster genes.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the phospholipase A2 family of proteins. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, at least one of which encodes a preproprotein that is proteolytically processed to generate the mature enzyme. This calcium-dependent enzyme hydrolyzes glycerophospholipids to produce free fatty acids and lysophospholipids. In one example, this enzyme catalyzes the release of arachidonic acid from cell membrane phospholipids, thus playing a role in the production of various inflammatory lipid mediators, such as prostaglandins. The encoded protein may promote the survival of breast cancer cells through its role in lipid metabolism.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes the beta subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase, a highly abundant multifunctional enzyme that belongs to the protein disulfide isomerase family. When present as a tetramer consisting of two alpha and two beta subunits, this enzyme is involved in hydroxylation of prolyl residues in preprocollagen. This enzyme is also a disulfide isomerase containing two thioredoxin domains that catalyze the formation, breakage and rearrangement of disulfide bonds. Other known functions include its ability to act as a chaperone that inhibits aggregation of misfolded proteins in a concentration-dependent manner, its ability to bind thyroid hormone, its role in both the influx and efflux of S-nitrosothiol-bound nitric oxide, and its function as a subunit of the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein complex.","Variant counts

Summary
This tumor suppressor gene is a member of a nuclear histone/protein methyltransferase superfamily. It encodes a zinc finger protein that can bind to retinoblastoma protein, estrogen receptor, and the TPA-responsive element (MTE) of the heme-oxygenase-1 gene. Although the functions of this protein have not been fully characterized, it may (1) play a role in transcriptional regulation during neuronal differentiation and pathogenesis of retinoblastoma, (2) act as a transcriptional activator of the heme-oxygenase-1 gene, and (3) be a specific effector of estrogen action. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that belongs to a conserved family of histone methyltransferases that predominantly act as negative regulators of transcription. The encoded protein contains an N-terminal Su(var)3-9, Enhancer-of-zeste, and Trithorax (SET) domain and a double zinc-finger domain. Knockout of this gene in mouse results in mistargeting by neurons of the dorsal telencephalon, abnormal itch-like behavior, and impaired differentiation of rod bipolar cells. In humans, the protein has been shown to interact with the phosphatase laforin and the ubiquitin ligase malin, which regulate glycogen construction in the cytoplasm. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is similar to PPAR-gamma coactivator 1 (PPARGC1/PGC-1), a protein that can activate mitochondrial biogenesis in part through a direct interaction with nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1). This protein has been shown to interact with NRF1. It is thought to be a functional relative of PPAR-gamma coactivator 1 that activates mitochondrial biogenesis through NRF1 in response to proliferative signals. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a subunit of the splicing factor 3b protein complex. Splicing factor 3b, together with splicing factor 3a and a 12S RNA unit, forms the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins complex (U2 snRNP). The splicing factor 3b/3a complex binds pre-mRNA upstream of the intron's branch site in a sequence-independent manner and may anchor the U2 snRNP to the pre-mRNA. The protein encoded by this gene contains a PHD-finger-like domain that is flanked by highly basic N- and C-termini. This protein belongs to the PHD-finger superfamily and may act as a chromatin-associated protein. This gene has several pseudogenes on different chromosomes.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the plexin-A family of semaphorin co-receptors. Semaphorins are a large family of secreted or membrane-bound proteins that mediate repulsive effects on axon pathfinding during nervous system development. A subset of semaphorins are recognized by plexin-A/neuropilin transmembrane receptor complexes, triggering a cellular signal transduction cascade that leads to axon repulsion. This plexin-A family member is thought to transduce signals from semaphorin-3A and -3C.","Variant counts

In human, ZIM2 and PEG3 (GeneID:5178) are two distinct genes that share a set of 5' exons and have a common promoter, and both genes are paternally expressed. Alternative splicing events connect the shared exons either with the remaining 4 exons unique to ZIM2, or with the remaining 2 exons unique to PEG3. This is in contrast to mouse and cow, where ZIM2 and PEG3 genes do not share exons in common, and the imprinting status of ZIM2 is also not conserved amongst mammals. Additional 5' alternatively spliced transcripts encoding the same protein have been found for the human ZIM2 gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The 26S proteasome is a multicatalytic proteinase complex with a highly ordered structure composed of 2 complexes, a 20S core and a 19S regulator. The 20S core is composed of 4 rings of 28 non-identical subunits; 2 rings are composed of 7 alpha subunits and 2 rings are composed of 7 beta subunits. The 19S regulator is composed of a base, which contains 6 ATPase subunits and 2 non-ATPase subunits, and a lid, which contains up to 10 non-ATPase subunits. Proteasomes are distributed throughout eukaryotic cells at a high concentration and cleave peptides in an ATP/ubiquitin-dependent process in a non-lysosomal pathway. An essential function of a modified proteasome, the immunoproteasome, is the processing of class I MHC peptides. This gene encodes a protein that inhibits the activation of the proteasome by the 11S and 19S regulators. Alternative transcript variants have been identified for this gene.","Variant counts

The activity of this receptor is mediated by G proteins which activate adenylyl cyclase and also a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system. Defects in this receptor are known to be the cause of Jansen's metaphyseal chondrodysplasia (JMC), chondrodysplasia Blomstrand type (BOCD), as well as enchodromatosis. Two transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) is one of the three components (E1, E2, and E3) of the large pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases catalyze phosphorylation of serine residues of E1 to inactivate the E1 component and inhibit the complex. Pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatases catalyze the dephosphorylation and activation of the E1 component to reverse the effects of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases. Pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase is a heterodimer consisting of catalytic and regulatory subunits. Two catalytic subunits have been reported; one is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle and another one is is much more abundant in the liver. The catalytic subunit, encoded by this gene, is the former, and belongs to the protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C) superfamily. Along with the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases, this enzyme is located in the mitochondrial matrix. Mutation in this gene causes pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase deficiency. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a nuclear protein that belongs to the PBX homeobox family of transcriptional factors. Studies in mice suggest that this gene may be involved in the regulation of osteogenesis and required for skeletal patterning and programming. A chromosomal translocation, t(1;19) involving this gene and TCF3/E2A gene, is associated with pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The resulting fusion protein, in which the DNA binding domain of E2A is replaced by the DNA binding domain of this protein, transforms cells by constitutively activating transcription of genes regulated by the PBX protein family. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase (PTGS), also known as cyclooxygenase, is the key enzyme in prostaglandin biosynthesis, and acts both as a dioxygenase and as a peroxidase. There are two isozymes of PTGS: a constitutive PTGS1 and an inducible PTGS2, which differ in their regulation of expression and tissue distribution. This gene encodes the inducible isozyme. It is regulated by specific stimulatory events, suggesting that it is responsible for the prostanoid biosynthesis involved in inflammation and mitogenesis.","Variant counts

Summary
This is one of two genes encoding similar enzymes that catalyze the conversion of arachinodate to prostaglandin. The encoded protein regulates angiogenesis in endothelial cells, and is inhibited by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin. Based on its ability to function as both a cyclooxygenase and as a peroxidase, the encoded protein has been identified as a moonlighting protein. The protein may promote cell proliferation during tumor progression. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
Phosphorylated derivatives of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) regulate cytoskeletal functions, membrane trafficking, and receptor signaling by recruiting protein complexes to cell- and endosomal-membranes. Humans have multiple PtdIns proteins that differ by the degree and position of phosphorylation of the inositol ring. This gene encodes an enzyme (PIKfyve; also known as phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate 5-kinase type III or PIPKIII) that phosphorylates the D-5 position in PtdIns and phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) to make PtdIns5P and PtdIns(3,5)biphosphate. The D-5 position also can be phosphorylated by type I PtdIns4P-5-kinases (PIP5Ks) that are encoded by distinct genes and preferentially phosphorylate D-4 phosphorylated PtdIns. In contrast, PIKfyve preferentially phosphorylates D-3 phosphorylated PtdIns. In addition to being a lipid kinase, PIKfyve also has protein kinase activity. PIKfyve regulates endomembrane homeostasis and plays a role in the biogenesis of endosome carrier vesicles from early endosomes. Mutations in this gene cause corneal fleck dystrophy (CFD); an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by numerous small white flecks present in all layers of the corneal stroma. Histologically, these flecks appear to be keratocytes distended with lipid and mucopolysaccharide filled intracytoplasmic vacuoles. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
The reciprocal translocation t(1;3)(p36;q21) occurs in a subset of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This gene is located near the 1p36.3 breakpoint and has been shown to be specifically expressed in the t(1:3)(p36,q21)-positive MDS/AML. The protein encoded by this gene is a zinc finger transcription factor and contains an N-terminal PR domain. The translocation results in the overexpression of a truncated version of this protein that lacks the PR domain, which may play an important role in the pathogenesis of MDS and AML. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been reported.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a catalytic subunit of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK is a heterotrimer consisting of an alpha catalytic subunit, and non-catalytic beta and gamma subunits. AMPK is an important energy-sensing enzyme that monitors cellular energy status. In response to cellular metabolic stresses, AMPK is activated, and thus phosphorylates and inactivates acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and beta-hydroxy beta-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), key enzymes involved in regulating de novo biosynthesis of fatty acid and cholesterol. Studies of the mouse counterpart suggest that this catalytic subunit may control whole-body insulin sensitivity and is necessary for maintaining myocardial energy homeostasis during ischemia.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the ser/thr protein kinase family. It is the catalytic subunit of the 5'-prime-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK is a cellular energy sensor conserved in all eukaryotic cells. The kinase activity of AMPK is activated by the stimuli that increase the cellular AMP/ATP ratio. AMPK regulates the activities of a number of key metabolic enzymes through phosphorylation.

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that binds the plus-end directed microtubule motor protein kinesin, together with the lysosomal GTPase Arl8, and is required for lysosomes to distribute away from the microtubule-organizing center. The encoded protein belongs to the multisubunit BLOC-one-related complex that regulates lysosome positioning. It binds a Salmonella effector protein called Salmonella induced filament A and is a critical host determinant in Salmonella pathogenesis. It has a domain architecture consisting of an N-terminal RPIP8, UNC-14, and NESCA (RUN) domain that binds kinesin-1 as well as the lysosomal GTPase Arl8, and a C-terminal pleckstrin homology domain that binds the Salmonella induced filament A effector protein. Naturally occurring mutations in this gene lead to abnormal localization of lysosomes, impaired autophagy flux and are associated with recessive dilated cardiomyopathy and left ventricular noncompaction.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the highly conserved polo-like kinase family of serine/threonine kinases. Members of this family are characterized by an amino-terminal kinase domain and a carboxy-terminal bipartite polo box domain that functions as a substrate-binding motif and a cellular localization signal. Polo-like kinases are important regulators of cell cycle progression. This gene has also been implicated in stress responses and double-strand break repair. In human cell lines, this protein is reported to associate with centrosomes in a microtubule-dependent manner, and during mitosis, the protein becomes localized to the mitotic apparatus. Expression of a kinase-defective mutant results in abnormal cell morphology caused by changes in microtubule dynamics and mitotic arrest followed by apoptosis.","Variant counts

Summary
Mitochondrial DNA polymerase is heterotrimeric, consisting of a homodimer of accessory subunits plus a catalytic subunit. The protein encoded by this gene is the catalytic subunit of mitochondrial DNA polymerase. The encoded protein contains a polyglutamine tract near its N-terminus that may be polymorphic. Defects in this gene are a cause of progressive external ophthalmoplegia with mitochondrial DNA deletions 1 (PEOA1), sensory ataxic neuropathy dysarthria and ophthalmoparesis (SANDO), Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome (AHS), and mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy syndrome (MNGIE). Two transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene contains a RING finger motif and is similar to the polycomb group (PcG) gene products. PcG gene products form complexes via protein-protein interaction and maintain the transcription repression of genes involved in embryogenesis, cell cycles, and tumorigenesis. This protein was shown to act as a negative regulator of transcription and has tumor suppressor activity. The expression of this gene was detected in various tumor cells, but is limited in neural organs in normal tissues. Knockout studies in mice suggested that this protein may negatively regulate the expression of different cytokines, chemokines, and chemokine receptors, and thus plays an important role in lymphocyte differentiation and migration, as well as in immune responses.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell membrane glycoprotein. In addition to being highly expressed in the prostate it is also expressed in the bladder, placenta, colon, kidney, and stomach. This gene is up-regulated in a large proportion of prostate cancers and is also detected in cancers of the bladder and pancreas. This gene includes a polymorphism that results in an upstream start codon in some individuals; this polymorphism is thought to be associated with a risk for certain gastric and bladder cancers. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the kernel lipocalin superfamily whose members share relatively low sequence similarity but have highly conserved exon/intron structure and three-dimensional protein folding. Most lipocalins are clustered on the long arm of chromosome 9. The encoded glycoprotein has been previously referred to as pregnancy-associated endometrial alpha-2-globulin, placental protein 14, and glycodelin, but has been officially named progestagen-associated endometrial protein. Three distinct forms, with identical protein backbones but different glycosylation profiles, are found in amniotic fluid, follicular fluid and seminal plasma of the reproductive system. These glycoproteins have distinct and essential roles in regulating a uterine environment suitable for pregnancy and in the timing and occurrence of the appropriate sequence of events in the fertilization process. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the protein kinase C superfamily. This kinase is activated by Rho family of small G proteins and may mediate the Rho-dependent signaling pathway. This kinase can be activated by phospholipids and by limited proteolysis. The 3-phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase-1 (PDPK1/PDK1) is reported to phosphorylate this kinase, which may mediate insulin signals to the actin cytoskeleton. The proteolytic activation of this kinase by caspase-3 or related proteases during apoptosis suggests its role in signal transduction related to apoptosis. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been observed.","Variant counts

Summary
Protein phosphatase 2 (formerly named type 2A) is one of the four major Ser/Thr phosphatases and is implicated in the negative control of cell growth and division. Protein phosphatase 2 holoenzymes are heterotrimeric proteins composed of a structural subunit A, a catalytic subunit C, and a regulatory subunit B. The regulatory subunit is encoded by a diverse set of genes that have been grouped into the B/PR55, B'/PR61, and B''/PR72 families. These different regulatory subunits confer distinct enzymatic specificities and intracellular localizations to the holozenzyme. The product of this gene belongs to the B'' family. The B'' family has been further divided into subfamilies. The product of this gene belongs to the beta subfamily of regulatory subunit B''.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a receptor for the anterior pituitary hormone, prolactin, and belongs to the type I cytokine receptor family. Prolactin-dependent signaling occurs as the result of ligand-induced dimerization of the prolactin receptor. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different membrane-bound and soluble isoforms have been described for this gene, which may function to modulate the endocrine and autocrine effects of prolactin in normal tissue and cancer.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene belongs to the protocadherin gene family, a subfamily of the cadherin superfamily. The gene encodes an integral membrane protein that is thought to function in cell adhesion in a CNS-specific manner. Unlike classical cadherins, which are generally encoded by 15-17 exons, this gene includes only 3 exons. Notable is the large first exon encoding the extracellular region, including 6 cadherin domains and a transmembrane region. Alternative splicing yields isoforms with unique cytoplasmic tails.","Variant counts
The variants found in rare patients tested by 3billion are classified and counted according to ACMG guidelines. The variants with over 5% variant frequency in population genome databases ( gnomAD, dbSNP, etc) are excluded.

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the G-protein coupled receptor family. This protein is one of four receptors identified for prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). This receptor can activate T-cell factor signaling. It has been shown to mediate PGE2 induced expression of early growth response 1 (EGR1), regulate the level and stability of cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA, and lead to the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3. Knockout studies in mice suggest that this receptor may be involved in the neonatal adaptation of circulatory system, osteoporosis, as well as initiation of skin immune responses.","Variant counts

Summary
The 26S proteasome is a multicatalytic proteinase complex with a highly ordered structure composed of 2 complexes, a 20S core and a 19S regulator. The 20S core is composed of 4 rings of 28 non-identical subunits; 2 rings are composed of 7 alpha subunits and 2 rings are composed of 7 beta subunits. The 19S regulator is composed of a base, which contains 6 ATPase subunits and 2 non-ATPase subunits, and a lid, which contains up to 10 non-ATPase subunits. Proteasomes are distributed throughout eukaryotic cells at a high concentration and cleave peptides in an ATP/ubiquitin-dependent process in a non-lysosomal pathway. An essential function of a modified proteasome, the immunoproteasome, is the processing of class I MHC peptides. This gene encodes a non-ATPase subunit of the 19S regulator. Three transcript variants encoding two different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes one of the catalytic subunits of protein kinase A, which exists as a tetrameric holoenzyme with two regulatory subunits and two catalytic subunits, in its inactive form. cAMP causes the dissociation of the inactive holoenzyme into a dimer of regulatory subunits bound to four cAMP and two free monomeric catalytic subunits. Four different regulatory subunits and three catalytic subunits have been identified in humans. cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of proteins by protein kinase A is important to many cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. Constitutive activation of this gene caused either by somatic mutations, or genomic duplications of regions that include this gene, have been associated with hyperplasias and adenomas of the adrenal cortex and are linked to corticotropin-independent Cushing's syndrome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. Tissue-specific isoforms that differ at the N-terminus have been described, and these isoforms may differ in the post-translational modifications that occur at the N-terminus of some isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
Most mRNAs, except for histones, contain a 3-prime poly(A) tail. Poly(A)-binding protein (PABP; see MIM 604679) enhances translation by circularizing mRNA through its interaction with the translation initiation factor EIF4G1 (MIM 600495) and the poly(A) tail. Various PABP-binding proteins regulate PABP activity, including PAIP1 (MIM 605184), a translational stimulator, and PAIP2A (MIM 605604) and PAIP2B, translational inhibitors (Derry et al., 2006 [PubMed 17381337]).","Variant counts

Summary
This is a paternally expressed imprinted gene that is thought to have been derived from the Ty3/Gypsy family of retrotransposons. It contains two overlapping open reading frames, RF1 and RF2, and expresses two proteins: a shorter, gag-like protein (with a CCHC-type zinc finger domain) from RF1; and a longer, gag/pol-like fusion protein (with an additional aspartic protease motif) from RF1/RF2 by -1 translational frameshifting (-1 FS). While -1 FS has been observed in RNA viruses and transposons in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, this gene represents the first example of -1 FS in a eukaryotic cellular gene. This gene is highly conserved across mammalian species and retains the heptanucleotide (GGGAAAC) and pseudoknot elements required for -1 FS. It is expressed in adult and embryonic tissues (most notably in placenta) and reported to have a role in cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Overexpression of this gene has been associated with several malignancies, such as hepatocellular carcinoma and B-cell lymphocytic leukemia. Knockout mice lacking this gene showed early embryonic lethality with placental defects, indicating the importance of this gene in embryonic development. Additional isoforms resulting from alternatively spliced transcript variants, and use of upstream non-AUG (CUG) start codon have been reported for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-specific phospholipase that primarily localizes to the Golgi apparatus. This ubiquitously expressed gene is predicted to encode a seven-transmembrane protein that removes unsaturated fatty acids from the sn-2 position of GPI. The remodeling of the constituent fatty acids on GPI is thought to be important for the proper association between GPI-anchored proteins and lipid rafts. The tethering of proteins to plasma membranes via posttranslational GPI-anchoring is thought to play a role in protein sorting and trafficking. Mutations in this gene cause an autosomal recessive form of neurologic hyperphosphatasia with cognitive disability (HPMRS4). Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
Phosphorylase kinase is a polymer of 16 subunits, four each of alpha, beta, gamma and delta. The alpha subunit includes the skeletal muscle and hepatic isoforms, encoded by two different genes. The beta subunit is the same in both the muscle and hepatic isoforms, and encoded by one gene. The gamma subunit also includes the skeletal muscle and hepatic isoforms, and the hepatic isoform is encoded by this gene. The delta subunit is a calmodulin and can be encoded by three different genes. The gamma subunits contain the active site of the enzyme, whereas the alpha and beta subunits have regulatory functions controlled by phosphorylation. The delta subunit mediates the dependence of the enzyme on calcium concentration. Mutations in this gene cause glycogen storage disease type 9C, also known as autosomal liver glycogenosis. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified in this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The product of this gene belongs to the family of P2 receptors, which is activated by extracellular nucleotides and subdivided into P2X ligand-gated ion channels and P2Y G-protein coupled receptors. This family has several receptor subtypes with different pharmacological selectivity, which overlaps in some cases, for various adenosine and uridine nucleotides. This receptor, which is a G-protein coupled receptor, is responsive to UDP, partially responsive to UTP and ADP, and not responsive to ATP. It is proposed that this receptor mediates inflammatory responses. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants that encode different protein isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family. The TRIM motif includes three zinc-binding domains, a RING, a B-box type 1 and a B-box type 2, and a coiled-coil region. This phosphoprotein localizes to nuclear bodies where it functions as a transcription factor and tumor suppressor. Its expression is cell-cycle related and it regulates the p53 response to oncogenic signals. The gene is often involved in the translocation with the retinoic acid receptor alpha gene associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Extensive alternative splicing of this gene results in several variations of the protein's central and C-terminal regions; all variants encode the same N-terminus. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a regulatory subunit of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK is a heterotrimer consisting of an alpha catalytic subunit, and non-catalytic beta and gamma subunits. AMPK is an important energy-sensing enzyme that monitors cellular energy status. In response to cellular metabolic stresses, AMPK is activated, and thus phosphorylates and inactivates acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and beta-hydroxy beta-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), key enzymes involved in regulating de novo biosynthesis of fatty acid and cholesterol. This subunit may be a positive regulator of AMPK activity. It is highly expressed in skeletal muscle and thus may have tissue-specific roles. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the paired box (PAX) family of transcription factors. The central feature of this gene family is a novel, highly conserved DNA-binding motif, known as the paired box. Paired box transcription factors are important regulators in early development, and alterations in the expression of their genes are thought to contribute to neoplastic transformation. This gene encodes the B-cell lineage specific activator protein that is expressed at early, but not late stages of B-cell differentiation. Its expression has also been detected in developing CNS and testis and so the encoded protein may also play a role in neural development and spermatogenesis. This gene is located at 9p13, which is involved in t(9;14)(p13;q32) translocations recurring in small lymphocytic lymphomas of the plasmacytoid subtype, and in derived large-cell lymphomas. This translocation brings the potent E-mu enhancer of the IgH gene into close proximity of the PAX5 promoter, suggesting that the deregulation of transcription of this gene contributes to the pathogenesis of these lymphomas. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes paired box protein Pax-6, one of many human homologs of the Drosophila melanogaster gene prd. In addition to a conserved paired box domain, a hallmark feature of this gene family, the encoded protein also contains a homeobox domain. Both domains are known to bind DNA and function as regulators of gene transcription. Activity of this protein is key in the development of neural tissues, particularly the eye. This gene is regulated by multiple enhancers located up to hundreds of kilobases distant from this locus. Mutations in this gene or in the enhancer regions can cause ocular disorders such as aniridia and Peter's anomaly. Use of alternate promoters and alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. Interestingly, inclusion of a particular alternate coding exon has been shown to increase the length of the paired box domain and alter its DNA binding specificity. Consequently, isoforms that carry the shorter paired box domain regulate a different set of genes compared to the isoforms carrying the longer paired box domain.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is necessary for early peroxisomal biogenesis. It acts both as a cytosolic chaperone and as an import receptor for peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs). Peroxins (PEXs) are proteins that are essential for the assembly of functional peroxisomes. The peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) are a group of genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive, lethal diseases characterized by multiple defects in peroxisome function. These disorders have at least 14 complementation groups, with more than one phenotype being observed for some complementation groups. Although the clinical features of PBD patients vary, cells from all PBD patients exhibit a defect in the import of one or more classes of peroxisomal matrix proteins into the organelle. Defects in this gene are a cause of Zellweger syndrome (ZWS), as well as peroxisome biogenesis disorder complementation group 14 (PBD-CG14), which is also known as PBD-CGJ. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes an essential component of the peroxisomal import machinery. The protein is integrated into peroxisome membranes with its C-terminus exposed to the cytosol, and interacts with the cytosolic receptor for proteins containing a PTS1 peroxisomal targeting signal. The protein also functions as a transcriptional corepressor and interacts with a histone deacetylase. A mutation in this gene results in one form of Zellweger syndrome.","Variant counts

Summary
The 26S proteasome is a multicatalytic proteinase complex with a highly ordered structure composed of 2 complexes, a 20S core and a 19S regulator. The 20S core is composed of 4 rings of 28 non-identical subunits; 2 rings are composed of 7 alpha subunits and 2 rings are composed of 7 beta subunits. The 19S regulator is composed of a base, which contains 6 ATPase subunits and 2 non-ATPase subunits, and a lid, which contains up to 10 non-ATPase subunits. Proteasomes are distributed throughout eukaryotic cells at a high concentration and cleave peptides in an ATP/ubiquitin-dependent process in a non-lysosomal pathway. An essential function of a modified proteasome, the immunoproteasome, is the processing of class I MHC peptides. This gene encodes one of the ATPase subunits, a member of the triple-A family of ATPases which have a chaperone-like activity. This subunit and a 20S core alpha subunit interact specifically with the hepatitis B virus X protein, a protein critical to viral replication. This subunit also interacts with the adenovirus E1A protein and this interaction alters the activity of the proteasome. Finally, this subunit interacts with ataxin-7, suggesting a role for the proteasome in the development of spinocerebellar ataxia type 7, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder.","Variant counts

This subunit may also compete with PSMC3 for binding to the HIV tat protein to regulate the interaction between the viral protein and the transcription complex. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a seven-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptor for platelet-activating factor (PAF) that localizes to lipid rafts and/or caveolae in the cell membrane. PAF (1-0-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine) is a phospholipid that plays a significant role in oncogenic transformation, tumor growth, angiogenesis, metastasis, and pro-inflammatory processes. Binding of PAF to the PAF-receptor (PAFR) stimulates numerous signal transduction pathways including phospholipase C, D, A2, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and the phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system. Following PAFR activation, cells become rapidly desensitized and this refractory state is dependent on PAFR phosphorylation, internalization, and down-regulation. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
Guanylyl cyclase C (GCC, or GUCY2C; MIM 601330) produces cGMP following the binding of either endogenous ligands or heat-stable enterotoxins secreted by E. coli and other enteric bacteria. Activation of GCC initiates a signaling cascade that leads to phosphorylation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR; MIM 602421), followed by a net efflux of ions and water into the intestinal lumen. IKEPP is a regulatory protein that associates with GCC and regulates the amount of cGMP produced following receptor stimulation (Scott et al., 2002 [PubMed 11950846]).","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene contains six PDZ domains and shares sequence similarity with pro-interleukin-16 (pro-IL-16). Like pro-IL-16, the encoded protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and is thought to be cleaved by a caspase to produce a secreted peptide containing two PDZ domains. In addition, this gene is upregulated in primary prostate tumors and may be involved in the early stages of prostate tumorigenesis.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a protein with a putative role in the localization of trans-Golgi network (TGN) membrane proteins. Mouse and rat homologs have been identified and studies of the homologous rat protein indicate a role in directing TGN localization of furin by binding to the protease's phosphorylated cytosolic domain. In addition, the human protein plays a role in HIV-1 Nef-mediated downregulation of cell surface MHC-I molecules to the TGN, thereby enabling HIV-1 to escape immune surveillance.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is highly expressed in late-pregnancy serum and is similar in structure to alpha-2-macroglobulin. The encoded protein, which acts as a homotetramer, inhibits the activity of all four classes of proteinases. This protein contains cleavage sites for several proteinases. Upon binding of a proteinase, the conformation of this protein changes to trap the proteinase, limiting its activity. This protein appears to be elevated in the sera of presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease patients.","Variant counts

Summary
This locus represents naturally occurring read-through transcription between the neighboring PMF1 (polyamine-modulated factor 1) and BGLAP (bone gamma-carboxyglutamate Gla protein) genes on chromosome 1. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding isoforms that share sequence identity with the upstream gene product, but they contain distinct C-termini due to frameshifts versus the downstream gene coding sequence.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the protocadherin gamma gene cluster, one of three related clusters tandemly linked on chromosome five. These gene clusters have an immunoglobulin-like organization, suggesting that a novel mechanism may be involved in their regulation and expression. The gamma gene cluster includes 22 genes divided into 3 subfamilies. Subfamily A contains 12 genes, subfamily B contains 7 genes and 2 pseudogenes, and the more distantly related subfamily C contains 3 genes. The tandem array of 22 large, variable region exons are followed by a constant region, containing 3 exons shared by all genes in the cluster. Each variable region exon encodes the extracellular region, which includes 6 cadherin ectodomains and a transmembrane region. The constant region exons encode the common cytoplasmic region. These neural cadherin-like cell adhesion proteins most likely play a critical role in the establishment and function of specific cell-cell connections in the brain. Alternative splicing has been described for the gamma cluster genes.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the pterin-4-alpha-carbinolamine dehydratase family. The encoded protein has been identified as a moonlighting protein based on its ability to perform mechanistically distinct functions. The encoded protein functions as both a dehydratase involved in tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthesis, and as a cofactor for HNF1A-dependent transcription. A deficiency of this enzyme leads to hyperphenylalaninemia. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a mitochondrial protein with antioxidant function. The protein is similar to the C22 subunit of Salmonella typhimurium alkylhydroperoxide reductase, and it can rescue bacterial resistance to alkylhydroperoxide in E. coli that lack the C22 subunit. The human and mouse genes are highly conserved, and they map to the regions syntenic between mouse and human chromosomes. Sequence comparisons with recently cloned mammalian homologs suggest that these genes consist of a family that is responsible for the regulation of cellular proliferation, differentiation and antioxidant functions. This family member can protect cells from oxidative stress, and it can promote cell survival in prostate cancer. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants. Related pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes 1, 3, 13 and 22.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is representative of a family of proteins composed of conserved PDZ and LIM domains. LIM domains are proposed to function in protein-protein recognition in a variety of contexts including gene transcription and development and in cytoskeletal interaction. The LIM domains of this protein bind to protein kinases, whereas the PDZ domain binds to actin filaments. The gene product is involved in the assembly of an actin filament-associated complex essential for transmission of ret/ptc2 mitogenic signaling. The biological function is likely to be that of an adapter, with the PDZ domain localizing the LIM-binding proteins to actin filaments of both skeletal muscle and nonmuscle tissues. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the LAR protein-tyrosine phosphatase-interacting protein (liprin) family. Liprins interact with members of LAR family of transmembrane protein tyrosine phosphatases, which are known to be important for axon guidance and mammary gland development. This protein binds to the intracellular membrane-distal phosphatase domain of tyrosine phosphatase LAR, and appears to localize LAR to cell focal adhesions. This interaction may regulate the disassembly of focal adhesion and thus help orchestrate cell-matrix interactions. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been described.","Variant counts

Summary
Armadillo-like proteins are characterized by a series of armadillo repeats, first defined in the Drosophila 'armadillo' gene product, that are typically 42 to 45 amino acids in length. These proteins can be divided into subfamilies based on their number of repeats, their overall sequence similarity, and the dispersion of the repeats throughout their sequences. Members of the p120(ctn)/plakophilin subfamily of Armadillo-like proteins, including CTNND1, CTNND2, PKP1, PKP2, PKP4, and ARVCF. PKP4 may be a component of desmosomal plaque and other adhesion plaques and is thought to be involved in regulating junctional plaque organization and cadherin function. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene catalyzes the first step in the catabolism of trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline, an amino acid derivative obtained through food intake and collagen turnover. One of the downstream products of this catabolism is glyoxylate, which in people with disorders of glyoxalate metabolism can lead to an increase in oxalate levels and the formation of calcium-oxalate kidney stones. Therefore, this gene may serve as a therapeutic target against primary hyperoxalurias (PH). This gene is similar to proline dehydrogenase (oxidase) 1, a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the first step in proline catabolism.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the protocadherin beta gene cluster, one of three related gene clusters tandemly linked on chromosome five. The gene clusters demonstrate an unusual genomic organization similar to that of B-cell and T-cell receptor gene clusters. The beta cluster contains 16 genes and 3 pseudogenes, each encoding 6 extracellular cadherin domains and a cytoplasmic tail that deviates from others in the cadherin superfamily. The extracellular domains interact in a homophilic manner to specify differential cell-cell connections. Unlike the alpha and gamma clusters, the transcripts from these genes are made up of only one large exon, not sharing common 3' exons as expected. These neural cadherin-like cell adhesion proteins are integral plasma membrane proteins. Their specific functions are unknown but they most likely play a critical role in the establishment and function of specific cell-cell neural connections.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the paraoxonase family of enzymes and exhibits lactonase and ester hydrolase activity. Following synthesis in the kidney and liver, the enzyme is secreted into the circulation, where it binds to high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles and hydrolyzes thiolactones and xenobiotics, including paraoxon, a metabolite of the insecticide parathion. Polymorphisms in this gene may be associated with coronary artery disease and diabetic retinopathy. The gene is found in a cluster of three related paraoxonase genes on chromosome 7.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the paraoxonase family and lies in a cluster on chromosome 7 with the other two family members. The encoded protein is secreted into the bloodstream and associates with high-density lipoprotein (HDL). The protein also rapidly hydrolyzes lactones and can inhibit the oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), a function that is believed to slow the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. Alternatively spliced variants which encode different protein isoforms have been described; however, only one has been fully characterized.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the paraoxonase gene family, which includes three known members located adjacent to each other on the long arm of chromosome 7. The encoded protein is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, membrane-bound, and may act as a cellular antioxidant, protecting cells from oxidative stress. Hydrolytic activity against acylhomoserine lactones, important bacterial quorum-sensing mediators, suggests the encoded protein may also play a role in defense responses to pathogenic bacteria. Mutations in this gene may be associated with vascular disease and a number of quantitative phenotypes related to diabetes. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a phospholipase enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate to generate two second messengers: inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). These second messengers subsequently regulate various processes affecting cell growth, differentiation, and gene expression. This enzyme is regulated by small monomeric GTPases of the Ras and Rho families and by heterotrimeric G proteins. In addition to its phospholipase C catalytic activity, this enzyme has an N-terminal domain with guanine nucleotide exchange (GEF) activity. Mutations in this gene cause early-onset nephrotic syndrome; characterized by proteinuria, edema, and diffuse mesangial sclerosis or focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein of the endoplasmic reticulum that interacts with lectin chaperones calreticulin and calnexin to modulate folding of newly synthesized glycoproteins. The protein was once thought to be a phospholipase; however, it has been demonstrated that the protein actually has protein disulfide isomerase activity. It is thought that complexes of lectins and this protein mediate protein folding by promoting formation of disulfide bonds in their glycoprotein substrates. This protein also functions as a molecular chaperone that prevents the formation of protein aggregates.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene is a leucine-rich repeat protein present in connective tissue extracellular matrix. This protein functions as a molecule anchoring basement membranes to the underlying connective tissue. This protein has been shown to bind type I collagen to basement membranes and type II collagen to cartilage. It also binds the basement membrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan perlecan. This protein is suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria (HGP), which is reported to lack the binding of collagen in basement membranes and cartilage. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein have been observed.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a type II methyltransferase. Post-translational modification of target proteins by PRMTs plays an important regulatory role in many biological processes, whereby PRMTs methylate arginine residues by transferring methyl groups from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to the guanidino nitrogen atoms of arginine. The protein encoded by this gene methylates spliceosome associated protein 145 to regulate alternative splicing and acts as a modulator of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein maturation. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the arginine N-methyltransferase family, which catalyze the sequential transfer of methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to the side chain nitrogens of arginine residues within proteins, to form methylated arginine derivatives and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine. This protein can catalyze both, the formation of omega-N monomethylarginine and asymmetrical dimethylarginine, with a strong preference for the latter. It specifically mediates the asymmetric dimethylation of Arg2 of histone H3, and the methylated form represents a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional repression. This protein also forms a complex with, and methylates DNA polymerase beta, resulting in stimulation of polymerase activity by enhancing DNA binding and processivity.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) family. The encoded protein is thought to function as an integrator of transcriptional repression and nuclear receptor signaling. It may inhibit the ligand-induced transcriptional activity of peroxisome proliferator activated receptors alpha and gamma, though evidence for this effect is inconsistent. Expression of this gene in colorectal cancer cells may be variable but is typically relatively low. Knockout studies in mice suggested a role for this protein in myelination of the corpus callosum, lipid metabolism, differentiation, and epidermal cell proliferation. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct protein isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
Peroxisome proliferators include hypolipidemic drugs, herbicides, leukotriene antagonists, and plasticizers; this term arises because they induce an increase in the size and number of peroxisomes. Peroxisomes are subcellular organelles found in plants and animals that contain enzymes for respiration and for cholesterol and lipid metabolism. The action of peroxisome proliferators is thought to be mediated via specific receptors, called PPARs, which belong to the steroid hormone receptor superfamily. PPARs affect the expression of target genes involved in cell proliferation, cell differentiation and in immune and inflammation responses. Three closely related subtypes (alpha, beta/delta, and gamma) have been identified. This gene encodes the subtype PPAR-alpha, which is a nuclear transcription factor. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described for this gene, although the full-length nature of only two has been determined.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene catalyzes the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. This reaction uses calcium as a cofactor and plays an important role in the intracellular transduction of receptor-mediated tyrosine kinase activators. For example, when activated by SRC, the encoded protein causes the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor RasGRP1 to translocate to the Golgi, where it activates Ras. Also, this protein has been shown to be a major substrate for heparin-binding growth factor 1 (acidic fibroblast growth factor)-activated tyrosine kinase. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes poly(ADP-ribosyl)transferase-like 2 protein, which contains a catalytic domain and is capable of catalyzing a poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation reaction. This protein has a catalytic domain which is homologous to that of poly (ADP-ribosyl) transferase, but lacks an N-terminal DNA binding domain which activates the C-terminal catalytic domain of poly (ADP-ribosyl) transferase. The basic residues within the N-terminal region of this protein may bear potential DNA-binding properties, and may be involved in the nuclear and/or nucleolar targeting of the protein. Two alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been found.","Variant counts

Summary
Plectin is a prominent member of an important family of structurally and in part functionally related proteins, termed plakins or cytolinkers, that are capable of interlinking different elements of the cytoskeleton. Plakins, with their multi-domain structure and enormous size, not only play crucial roles in maintaining cell and tissue integrity and orchestrating dynamic changes in cytoarchitecture and cell shape, but also serve as scaffolding platforms for the assembly, positioning, and regulation of signaling complexes (reviewed in PMID: 9701547, 11854008, and 17499243). Plectin is expressed as several protein isoforms in a wide range of cell types and tissues from a single gene located on chromosome 8 in humans (PMID: 8633055, 8698233). Until 2010, this locus was named plectin 1 (symbol PLEC1 in human; Plec1 in mouse and rat) and the gene product had been referred to as 'hemidesmosomal protein 1' or 'plectin 1, intermediate filament binding 500kDa'. These names were superseded by plectin. The plectin gene locus in mouse on chromosome 15 has been analyzed in detail (PMID: 10556294, 14559777), revealing a genomic exon-intron organization with well over 40 exons spanning over 62 kb and an unusual 5' transcript complexity of plectin isoforms. Eleven exons (1-1j) have been identified that alternatively splice directly into a common exon 2 which is the first exon to encode plectin's highly conserved actin binding domain (ABD). Three additional exons (-1, 0a, and 0) splice into an alternative first coding exon (1c), and two additional exons (2alpha and 3alpha) are optionally spliced within the exons encoding the acting binding domain (exons 2-8). Analysis of the human locus has identified eight of the eleven alternative 5' exons found in mouse and rat (PMID: 14672974); exons 1i, 1j and 1h have not been confirmed in human. Furthermore, isoforms lacking the central rod domain encoded by exon 31 have been detected in mouse (PMID:10556294), rat (PMID: 9177781), and human (PMID: 11441066, 10780662, 20052759). The short alternative amino-terminal sequences encoded by the different first exons direct the targeting of the various isoforms to distinct subcellular locations (PMID: 14559777). As the expression of specific plectin isoforms was found to be dependent on cell type (tissue) and stage of development (PMID: 10556294, 12542521, 17389230) it appears that each cell type (tissue) contains a unique set (proportion and composition) of plectin isoforms, as if custom-made for specific requirements of the particular cells. Concordantly, individual isoforms were found to carry out distinct and specific functions (PMID: 14559777, 12542521, 18541706). In 1996, a number of groups reported that patients suffering from epidermolysis bullosa simplex with muscular dystrophy (EBS-MD) lacked plectin expression in skin and muscle tissues due to defects in the plectin gene (PMID: 8698233, 8941634, 8636409, 8894687, 8696340). Two other subtypes of plectin-related EBS have been described: EBS-pyloric atresia (PA) and EBS-Ogna. For reviews of plectin-related diseases see PMID: 15810881, 19945614. Mutations in the plectin gene related to human diseases should be named based on the position in NM_000445 (variant 1, isoform 1c), unless the mutation is located within one of the other alternative first exons, in which case the position in the respective Reference Sequence should be used.","Variant counts

Summary
Photon absorption triggers a signaling cascade in rod photoreceptors that activates cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE), resulting in the rapid hydrolysis of cGMP, closure of cGMP-gated cation channels, and hyperpolarization of the cell. PDE is a peripheral membrane heterotrimeric enzyme made up of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits. This gene encodes the beta subunit. Mutations in this gene result in retinitis pigmentosa and autosomal dominant congenital stationary night blindness. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Protein phosphatase 2A is one of the four major Ser/Thr phosphatases and is implicated in the negative control of cell growth and division. Protein phosphatase 2A holoenzymes are heterotrimeric proteins composed of a structural subunit A, a catalytic subunit C, and a regulatory subunit B. The regulatory subunit is encoded by a diverse set of genes that have been grouped into the B/PR55, B'/PR61, and B''/PR72 families. These different regulatory subunits confer distinct enzymatic specificities and intracellular localizations to the holozenzyme. The product of this gene belongs to the B' family. This gene encodes a specific phosphotyrosyl phosphatase activator of the dimeric form of protein phosphatase 2A. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
The proteasome is a multicatalytic proteinase complex with a highly ordered ring-shaped 20S core structure. The core structure is composed of 4 rings of 28 non-identical subunits; 2 rings are composed of 7 alpha subunits and 2 rings are composed of 7 beta subunits. Proteasomes are distributed throughout eukaryotic cells at a high concentration and cleave peptides in an ATP/ubiquitin-dependent process in a non-lysosomal pathway. An essential function of a modified proteasome, the immunoproteasome, is the processing of class I MHC peptides. This gene encodes a member of the peptidase T1A family, that is a 20S core alpha subunit. Multiple transcript variants encoding several different isoforms have been found for this gene. A pseudogene has been identified on the Y chromosome.","Variant counts

Summary
Protein synthesis proceeds after formylation of methionine by methionyl-tRNA formyl transferase (FMT) and transfer of the charged initiator f-met tRNA to the ribosome. In eubacteria and eukaryotic organelles the product of this gene, peptide deformylase (PDF), removes the formyl group from the initiating methionine of nascent peptides. In eubacteria, deformylation of nascent peptides is required for subsequent cleavage of initiating methionines by methionine aminopeptidase. The discovery that a natural inhibitor of PDF, actinonin, acts as an antimicrobial agent in some bacteria has spurred intensive research into the design of bacterial-specific PDF inhibitors. In human cells, only mitochondrial proteins have N-formylation of initiating methionines. Protein inhibitors of PDF or siRNAs of PDF block the growth of cancer cell lines but have no effect on normal cell growth. In humans, PDF function may therefore be restricted to rapidly growing cells.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes the receptor for urokinase plasminogen activator and, given its role in localizing and promoting plasmin formation, likely influences many normal and pathological processes related to cell-surface plasminogen activation and localized degradation of the extracellular matrix. It binds both the proprotein and mature forms of urokinase plasminogen activator and permits the activation of the receptor-bound pro-enzyme by plasmin. The protein lacks transmembrane or cytoplasmic domains and may be anchored to the plasma membrane by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) moiety following cleavage of the nascent polypeptide near its carboxy-terminus. However, a soluble protein is also produced in some cell types. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. The proprotein experiences several post-translational cleavage reactions that have not yet been fully defined.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes an endoplasmic reticulum associated protein that is involved in glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) lipid anchor biosynthesis. The GPI lipid anchor is a glycolipid found on many blood cells and serves to anchor proteins to the cell surface. The encoded protein is one subunit of the GPI N-acetylglucosaminyl (GlcNAc) transferase that transfers GlcNAc to phosphatidylinositol (PI) on the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum. Two alternatively spliced transcripts that encode the same protein have been found for this gene. A pseudogene on chromosome 11 has also been characterized.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a type I transmembrane protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The protein is an essential component of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-mannosyltransferase I, which transfers the first of the four mannoses in the GPI-anchor precursors during GPI-anchor biosynthesis. Studies in rat indicate that the protein is translated from a non-AUG translation initiation site. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein phosphatase I-interacting protein that promotes the dephosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2A to regulate translation under conditions of cellular stress. The transcribed messenger RNA contains two upstream open reading frames (ORFs) that repress translation of the main protein coding ORF under normal conditions, while the protein coding ORF is expressed at high levels in response to stress. Continual translation of the mRNA under conditions of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2A inactivation is thought to create a feedback loop for reactivation of the gene during recovery from stress. In addition, it has been shown that this protein plays a role in membrane traffic that is independent of translation and that it is required for exocytosis from erythroleukemia cells. Allelic variants of this gene are associated with microcephaly, short stature, and impaired glucose metabolism.","Variant counts

Summary
Fibrillar collagen types I-III are synthesized as precursor molecules known as procollagens. These precursors contain amino- and carboxyl-terminal peptide extensions known as N- and C-propeptides, respectively, which are cleaved, upon secretion of procollagen from the cell, to yield the mature triple helical, highly structured fibrils. This gene encodes a glycoprotein which binds and drives the enzymatic cleavage of type I procollagen and heightens C-proteinase activity.","Variant counts

AMPK is a heterotrimer consisting of an alpha catalytic subunit, and non-catalytic beta and gamma subunits. AMPK is an important energy-sensing enzyme that monitors cellular energy status. In response to cellular metabolic stresses, AMPK is activated, and thus phosphorylates and inactivates acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and beta-hydroxy beta-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), key enzymes involved in regulating de novo biosynthesis of fatty acid and cholesterol. This subunit is one of the gamma regulatory subunits of AMPK. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been observed.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene was identified as a tumor suppressor that is mutated in a large number of cancers at high frequency. The protein encoded by this gene is a phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate 3-phosphatase. It contains a tensin like domain as well as a catalytic domain similar to that of the dual specificity protein tyrosine phosphatases. Unlike most of the protein tyrosine phosphatases, this protein preferentially dephosphorylates phosphoinositide substrates. It negatively regulates intracellular levels of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate in cells and functions as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating AKT/PKB signaling pathway. The use of a non-canonical (CUG) upstream initiation site produces a longer isoform that initiates translation with a leucine, and is thought to be preferentially associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane. This longer isoform may help regulate energy metabolism in the mitochondria. A pseudogene of this gene is found on chromosome 9. Alternative splicing and the use of multiple translation start codons results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
The encoded protein is a homolog of yeast securin proteins, which prevent separins from promoting sister chromatid separation. It is an anaphase-promoting complex (APC) substrate that associates with a separin until activation of the APC. The gene product has transforming activity in vitro and tumorigenic activity in vivo, and the gene is highly expressed in various tumors. The gene product contains 2 PXXP motifs, which are required for its transforming and tumorigenic activities, as well as for its stimulation of basic fibroblast growth factor expression. It also contains a destruction box (D box) that is required for its degradation by the APC. The acidic C-terminal region of the encoded protein can act as a transactivation domain. The gene product is mainly a cytosolic protein, although it partially localizes in the nucleus. Three transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the protocadherin gamma gene cluster, one of three related clusters tandemly linked on chromosome five. These gene clusters have an immunoglobulin-like organization, suggesting that a novel mechanism may be involved in their regulation and expression. The gamma gene cluster includes 22 genes divided into 3 subfamilies. Subfamily A contains 12 genes, subfamily B contains 7 genes and 2 pseudogenes, and the more distantly related subfamily C contains 3 genes. The tandem array of 22 large, variable region exons are followed by a constant region, containing 3 exons shared by all genes in the cluster. Each variable region exon encodes the extracellular region, which includes 6 cadherin ectodomains and a transmembrane region. The constant region exons encode the common cytoplasmic region. These neural cadherin-like cell adhesion proteins most likely play a critical role in the establishment and function of specific cell-cell connections in the brain. Alternative splicing has been described for the gamma cluster genes.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the protocadherin alpha gene cluster, one of three related gene clusters tandemly linked on chromosome five that demonstrate an unusual genomic organization similar to that of B-cell and T-cell receptor gene clusters. The alpha gene cluster is composed of 15 cadherin superfamily genes related to the mouse CNR genes and consists of 13 highly similar and 2 more distantly related coding sequences. The tandem array of 15 N-terminal exons, or variable exons, are followed by downstream C-terminal exons, or constant exons, which are shared by all genes in the cluster. The large, uninterrupted N-terminal exons each encode six cadherin ectodomains while the C-terminal exons encode the cytoplasmic domain. These neural cadherin-like cell adhesion proteins are integral plasma membrane proteins that most likely play a critical role in the establishment and function of specific cell-cell connections in the brain. Alternative splicing has been observed and additional variants have been suggested but their full-length nature has yet to be determined.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the AAA ATPase family, a large group of ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities. This protein is cytoplasmic but is often anchored to a peroxisomal membrane where it forms a heteromeric complex and plays a role in the import of proteins into peroxisomes and peroxisome biogenesis. Mutations in this gene have been associated with complementation group 1 peroxisomal disorders such as neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, infantile Refsum disease, and Zellweger syndrome. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The product of this gene is involved in peroxisome biosynthesis and integrity. It assembles membrane vesicles before the matrix proteins are translocated. Peroxins (PEXs) are proteins that are essential for the assembly of functional peroxisomes. The peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) are a group of genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive, lethal diseases characterized by multiple defects in peroxisome function. The peroxisomal biogenesis disorders are a heterogeneous group with at least 14 complementation groups and with more than 1 phenotype being observed in cases falling into particular complementation groups. Although the clinical features of PBD patients vary, cells from all PBD patients exhibit a defect in the import of one or more classes of peroxisomal matrix proteins into the organelle. Defects in this gene are a cause Zellweger syndrome (ZWS).","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes the cytosolic receptor for the set of peroxisomal matrix enzymes targeted to the organelle by the peroxisome targeting signal 2 (PTS2). Defects in this gene cause peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs), which are characterized by multiple defects in peroxisome function. There are at least 14 complementation groups for PBDs, with more than one phenotype being observed in cases falling into particular complementation groups. Although the clinical features of PBD patients vary, cells from all PBD patients exhibit a defect in the import of one or more classes of peroxisomal matrix proteins into the organelle. Defects in this gene have been associated with PBD complementation group 11 (PBD-CG11) disorders, rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 1 (RCDP1), and Refsum disease (RD).","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a preproprotein that undergoes extensive, tissue-specific, post-translational processing via cleavage by subtilisin-like enzymes known as prohormone convertases. There are eight potential cleavage sites within the preproprotein and, depending on tissue type and the available convertases, processing may yield as many as ten biologically active peptides involved in diverse cellular functions. The encoded protein is synthesized mainly in corticotroph cells of the anterior pituitary where four cleavage sites are used; adrenocorticotrophin, essential for normal steroidogenesis and the maintenance of normal adrenal weight, and lipotropin beta are the major end products. In other tissues, including the hypothalamus, placenta, and epithelium, all cleavage sites may be used, giving rise to peptides with roles in pain and energy homeostasis, melanocyte stimulation, and immune modulation. These include several distinct melanotropins, lipotropins, and endorphins that are contained within the adrenocorticotrophin and beta-lipotropin peptides. The antimicrobial melanotropin alpha peptide exhibits antibacterial and antifungal activity. Mutations in this gene have been associated with early onset obesity, adrenal insufficiency, and red hair pigmentation. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein have been described.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family. PTPs are known to be signaling molecules that regulate a variety of cellular processes including cell growth, differentiation, mitotic cycle, and oncogenic transformation. This PTP possesses an extracellular region, a single transmembrane region, and two tandem intracellular catalytic domains, and thus represents a receptor-type PTP. The extracellular region contains a meprin-A5 antigen-PTP (MAM) domain, Ig-like and fibronectin type III-like repeats. This PTP was thought to play roles in cell-cell recognition and adhesion. Studies of the similar gene in mice suggested the role of this PTP in early neural development. The expression of this gene was reported to be regulated by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or calcium ionophore in Jurkat T lymphoma cells. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been reported.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family. PTPs are known to be signaling molecules that regulate a variety of cellular processes including cell growth, differentiation, mitotic cycle, and oncogenic transformation. This PTP possesses an extracellular region, a single transmembrane region, and two tandem intracytoplasmic catalytic domains, and thus represents a receptor-type PTP. The extracellular region of this PTP contains a carbonic anhydrase-like (CAH) domain, which is also found in the extracellular region of PTPRBETA/ZETA. This gene is located in a chromosomal region that is frequently deleted in renal cell carcinoma and lung carcinoma, thus is thought to be a candidate tumor suppressor gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family. PTPs are known to be signaling molecules that regulate a variety of cellular processes including cell growth, differentiation, mitotic cycle, and oncogenic transformation. This PTP possesses an extracellular region, a single transmembrane region, and two tandem intracytoplasmic catalytic domains, and thus represents a receptor-type PTP. The extracellular region contains three Ig-like domains, and nine non-Ig like domains similar to that of neural-cell adhesion molecule. This PTP was shown to function in the regulation of epithelial cell-cell contacts at adherents junctions, as well as in the control of beta-catenin signaling. An increased expression level of this protein was found in the insulin-responsive tissue of obese, insulin-resistant individuals, and may contribute to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. Two alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene, which encode distinct proteins, have been reported.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family. PTPs are known to be signaling molecules that regulate a variety of cellular processes including cell growth, differentiation, mitotic cycle, and oncogenic transformation. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been reported, at least two of which encode a receptor-type PTP that possesses a short extracellular domain, a single transmembrane region, and two tandem intracytoplasmic catalytic domains; another one encodes a PTP that contains a distinct hydrophilic N-terminus, and thus represents a nonreceptor-type isoform of this PTP. Studies of the similar gene in mice suggested the regulatory roles of this PTP in RAS related signal transduction pathways, cytokine-induced SATA signaling, as well as the activation of voltage-gated K+ channels.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family. PTPs are known to be signaling molecules that regulate a variety of cellular processes including cell growth, differentiation, mitosis, and oncogenic transformation. This PTP contains an extracellular domain, a single transmembrane segment and two tandem intracytoplasmic catalytic domains, and thus is classified as a receptor type PTP. This PTP has been shown to be an essential regulator of T- and B-cell antigen receptor signaling. It functions through either direct interaction with components of the antigen receptor complexes, or by activating various Src family kinases required for the antigen receptor signaling. This PTP also suppresses JAK kinases, and thus functions as a regulator of cytokine receptor signaling. Alternatively spliced transcripts variants of this gene, which encode distinct isoforms, have been reported.","Variant counts

PTPs are known to be signaling molecules that regulate a variety of cellular processes including cell growth, differentiation, mitotic cycle, and oncogenic transformation. This PTP contains an extracellular domain, a single transmembrane segment and one intracytoplasmic catalytic domain, thus belongs to receptor type PTP. The extracellular region of this PTP is composed of multiple fibronectin type_III repeats, which was shown to interact with neuronal receptor and cell adhesion molecules, such as contactin and tenascin C. This protein was also found to interact with sodium channels, and thus may regulate sodium channels by altering tyrosine phosphorylation status. The functions of the interaction partners of this protein implicate the roles of this PTP in cell adhesion, neurite growth, and neuronal differentiation. Alternate transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the protocadherin beta gene cluster, one of three related gene clusters tandemly linked on chromosome five. The gene clusters demonstrate an unusual genomic organization similar to that of B-cell and T-cell receptor gene clusters. The beta cluster contains 16 genes and 3 pseudogenes, each encoding 6 extracellular cadherin domains and a cytoplasmic tail that deviates from others in the cadherin superfamily. The extracellular domains interact in a homophilic manner to specify differential cell-cell connections. Unlike the alpha and gamma clusters, the transcripts from these genes are made up of only one large exon, not sharing common 3' exons as expected. These neural cadherin-like cell adhesion proteins are integral plasma membrane proteins. Their specific functions are unknown but they most likely play a critical role in the establishment and function of specific cell-cell neural connections.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the protocadherin beta gene cluster, one of three related gene clusters tandemly linked on chromosome five. The gene clusters demonstrate an unusual genomic organization similar to that of B-cell and T-cell receptor gene clusters. The beta cluster contains 16 genes and 3 pseudogenes, each encoding 6 extracellular cadherin domains and a cytoplasmic tail that deviates from others in the cadherin superfamily. The extracellular domains interact in a homophilic manner to specify differential cell-cell connections. Unlike the alpha and gamma clusters, the transcripts from these genes are made up of only one large exon, not sharing common 3' exons as expected. These neural cadherin-like cell adhesion proteins are integral plasma membrane proteins. Their specific functions are unknown but they most likely play a critical role in the establishment and function of specific cell-cell neural connections.","Variant counts
The variants found in rare patients tested by 3billion are classified and counted according to ACMG guidelines. The variants with over 5% variant frequency in population genome databases ( gnomAD, dbSNP, etc) are excluded.

Summary
This gene is a member of the RNA polymerase II subunit 11 gene family, which includes three genes in a cluster on chromosome 7q22.1 and a pseudogene on chromosome 7p13. The founding member of this family, DNA directed RNA polymerase II polypeptide J, has been shown to encode a subunit of RNA polymerase II, the polymerase responsible for synthesizing messenger RNA in eukaryotes. This locus produces multiple, alternatively spliced transcripts that potentially express isoforms with distinct C-termini compared to DNA directed RNA polymerase II polypeptide J. Most or all variants are spliced to include additional non-coding exons at the 3' end which makes them candidates for nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). Consequently, it is not known if this locus expresses a protein or proteins in vivo.","Variant counts

Summary
This intronless gene is specifically expressed in the testis, and encodes a protein that is highly homologous to the two subunits of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase encoded by human X-linked genes, PRPS1 and PRPS2. These enzymes convert pyrimidine, purine or pyridine bases to the corresponding ribonucleoside monophosphates. In vitro transcription/translation and site-directed mutagenesis studies indicate that translation of this mRNA initiates exclusively at a non-AUG (ACG) codon.","Variant counts

Summary
Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) phosphorylate inositol lipids and are involved in the immune response. The protein encoded by this gene is a class I PI3K found primarily in leukocytes. Like other class I PI3Ks (p110-alpha p110-beta, and p110-gamma), the encoded protein binds p85 adapter proteins and GTP-bound RAS. However, unlike the other class I PI3Ks, this protein phosphorylates itself, not p85 protein.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a single-pass transmembrane protein containing an N-terminal gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain and tandem Pro/Leu-Pro-Xaa-Tyr (PY) motifs at its C-terminal end. The Gla domain is exposed on the cell surface while the PY motifs are cytoplasmic. The PY motifs of the encoded protein have been shown to interact with YAP1, a WW domain-containing protein. Therefore, it is thought that the encoded protein may be part of a signal transduction pathway. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

PAK proteins, a family of serine/threonine p21-activating kinases, include PAK1, PAK2, PAK3 and PAK4. PAK proteins are critical effectors that link Rho GTPases to cytoskeleton reorganization and nuclear signaling. They serve as targets for the small GTP binding proteins Cdc42 and Rac and have been implicated in a wide range of biological activities. PAK4 interacts specifically with the GTP-bound form of Cdc42Hs and weakly activates the JNK family of MAP kinases. PAK4 is a mediator of filopodia formation and may play a role in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the PAK family of Ser/Thr protein kinases. PAK family members are known to be effectors of Rac/Cdc42 GTPases, which have been implicated in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics, proliferation, and cell survival signaling. This kinase contains a CDC42/Rac1 interactive binding (CRIB) motif, and has been shown to bind CDC42 in the presence of GTP. This kinase is predominantly expressed in brain. It is capable of promoting neurite outgrowth, and thus may play a role in neurite development. This kinase is associated with microtubule networks and induces microtubule stabilization. The subcellular localization of this kinase is tightly regulated during cell cycle progression. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein have been described.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP) family. PAPs convert phosphatidic acid to diacylglycerol, and function in de novo synthesis of glycerolipids as well as in receptor-activated signal transduction mediated by phospholipase D. This protein is similar to phosphatidic acid phosphatase type 2A (PPAP2A) and type 2B (PPAP2B). All three proteins contain 6 transmembrane regions, and a consensus N-glycosylation site. This protein has been shown to possess membrane associated PAP activity. Three alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been reported.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene appears to have resulted from a fusion of DNA sequences derived from 2 distinct loci, specifically through the duplication of two internal exons from the POM121 gene and four 3' exons from the ZP3 gene. The 5' end of this gene is similar to the 5` coding region of the POM121 gene which encodes an integral nuclear pore membrane protein. However, the protein encoded by this gene lacks the nuclear pore localization motif. The 3' end of this gene is similar to the last 4 exons of the zona pellucida glycoprotein 3 (ZP3) gene and the encoded protein retains one zona pellucida domain. Multiple protein isoforms are encoded by transcript variants of this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that is related to the glycoprotein prosaposin. Based on sequence similarity between the encoded protein and prosaposin, it is predicted that the encoded protein is a preproprotein that is proteolytically processed to generate multiple protein products. These predicted products include saposins A-like, B-like, C-like, and D-like, which may play a role in the lysosomal degradation of sphingolipids.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to a small class of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family. PTPs are cell signaling molecules that play regulatory roles in a variety of cellular processes. PTPs in this class contain a protein tyrosine phosphatase catalytic domain and a characteristic C-terminal prenylation motif. This PTP has been shown to primarily associate with plasmic and endosomal membrane through its C-terminal prenylation. This PTP was found to interact with the beta-subunit of Rab geranylgeranyltransferase II (beta GGT II), and thus may function as a regulator of GGT II activity. Overexpression of this gene in mammalian cells conferred a transformed phenotype, which suggested its role in tumorigenesis. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described. Related pseudogenes exist on chromosomes 11, 12 and 17.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes an RNA-binding protein that is involved in growth regulation. This protein is present in pre-ribosomal ribonucleoprotein complexes and may be involved in ribosome assembly and the regulation of intermediate and late steps of rRNA processing. This protein can interact with the cytoplasmic domain of the ErbB3 receptor and may contribute to transducing growth regulatory signals. This protein is also a transcriptional co-repressor of androgen receptor-regulated genes and other cell cycle regulatory genes through its interactions with histone deacetylases. This protein has been implicated in growth inhibition and the induction of differentiation of human cancer cells. Six pseudogenes, located on chromosomes 3, 6, 9, 18, 20 and X, have been identified.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the peptidase family. The protein forms a homodimer that hydrolyzes dipeptides or tripeptides with C-terminal proline or hydroxyproline residues. The enzyme serves an important role in the recycling of proline, and may be rate limiting for the production of collagen. Mutations in this gene result in prolidase deficiency, which is characterized by the excretion of large amount of di- and tri-peptides containing proline. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the trypsin family of serine proteases and contains a signal peptide, a proline-rich region, a Kringle domain, four scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domains, and a trypsin-like serine protease domain. The protein, sometimes referred to as neurotrypsin or motopsin, is secreted from neuronal cells and localizes to the synaptic cleft. Studies in mice show that this protein cleaves a protein, agrin, that is important for the formation and maintenance of exitatory synapses. Defects in this gene cause a form of autosomal recessive cognitive impairment (MRT1).","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the protein kinase C (PKC) family of serine/threonine protein kinases. The PKC family comprises at least eight members, which are differentially expressed and are involved in a wide variety of cellular processes. This protein kinase is calcium-independent and phospholipid-dependent. It is not activated by phorbolesters or diacylglycerol. This kinase can be recruited to vesicle tubular clusters (VTCs) by direct interaction with the small GTPase RAB2, where this kinase phosphorylates glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPD/GAPDH) and plays a role in microtubule dynamics in the early secretory pathway. This kinase is found to be necessary for BCL-ABL-mediated resistance to drug-induced apoptosis and therefore protects leukemia cells against drug-induced apoptosis. There is a single exon pseudogene mapped on chromosome X.","Variant counts

Summary
Protein kinase C (PKC) is a family of serine- and threonine-specific protein kinases that can be activated by calcium and the second messenger diacylglycerol. PKC family members phosphorylate a wide variety of protein targets and are known to be involved in diverse cellular signaling pathways. PKC family members also serve as major receptors for phorbol esters, a class of tumor promoters. Each member of the PKC family has a specific expression profile and is believed to play a distinct role in cells. The protein encoded by this gene is one of the PKC family members. It is a calcium-independent and phospholipids-dependent protein kinase. It is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues and has been shown to reside specifically in the cell nucleus. This protein kinase can regulate keratinocyte differentiation by activating the MAP kinase MAPK13 (p38delta)-activated protein kinase cascade that targets CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA). It is also found to mediate the transcription activation of the transglutaminase 1 (TGM1) gene. Mutations in this gene are associated with susceptibility to cerebral infarction.","Variant counts

Summary
Protein kinase C (PKC) is a family of serine- and threonine-specific protein kinases that can be activated by calcium and second messenger diacylglycerol. PKC family members phosphorylate a wide variety of protein targets and are known to be involved in diverse cellular signaling pathways. PKC also serve as major receptors for phorbol esters, a class of tumor promoters. Each member of the PKC family has a specific expression profile and is believed to play distinct roles in cells. The protein encoded by this gene is one of the PKC family members. This protein kinase is expressed solely in the brain and spinal cord and its localization is restricted to neurons. It has been demonstrated that several neuronal functions, including long term potentiation (LTP) and long term depression (LTD), specifically require this kinase. Knockout studies in mice also suggest that this kinase may be involved in neuropathic pain development. Defects in this protein have been associated with neurodegenerative disorder spinocerebellar ataxia-14 (SCA14). Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Protein kinase C (PKC) zeta is a member of the PKC family of serine/threonine kinases which are involved in a variety of cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation and secretion. Unlike the classical PKC isoenzymes which are calcium-dependent, PKC zeta exhibits a kinase activity which is independent of calcium and diacylglycerol but not of phosphatidylserine. Furthermore, it is insensitive to typical PKC inhibitors and cannot be activated by phorbol ester. Unlike the classical PKC isoenzymes, it has only a single zinc finger module. These structural and biochemical properties indicate that the zeta subspecies is related to, but distinct from other isoenzymes of PKC. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
Protein kinase C (PKC) is a family of serine- and threonine-specific protein kinases that can be activated by calcium and the second messenger diacylglycerol. PKC family members phosphorylate a wide variety of protein targets and are known to be involved in diverse cellular signaling pathways. PKC family members also serve as major receptors for phorbol esters, a class of tumor promoters. Each member of the PKC family has a specific expression profile and is believed to play a distinct role. The protein encoded by this gene is one of the PKC family members. It is a calcium-independent and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase. This kinase is important for T-cell activation. It is required for the activation of the transcription factors NF-kappaB and AP-1, and may link the T cell receptor (TCR) signaling complex to the activation of the transcription factors.","Variant counts

Phosphorylase kinase is a polymer of 16 subunits, four each of alpha, beta, gamma and delta. The alpha subunit includes the skeletal muscle and hepatic isoforms, and the skeletal muscle isoform is encoded by this gene. The beta subunit is the same in both the muscle and hepatic isoforms, and encoded by one gene. The gamma subunit also includes the skeletal muscle and hepatic isoforms, which are encoded by two different genes. The delta subunit is a calmodulin and can be encoded by three different genes. The gamma subunits contain the active site of the enzyme, whereas the alpha and beta subunits have regulatory functions controlled by phosphorylation. The delta subunit mediates the dependence of the enzyme on calcium concentration. Mutations in this gene cause glycogen storage disease type 9D, also known as X-linked muscle glycogenosis. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified in this gene. A pseudogene has been found on chromosome 1.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a constant regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2. Protein phosphatase 2 is one of the four major Ser/Thr phosphatases, and it is implicated in the negative control of cell growth and division. It consists of a common heteromeric core enzyme, which is composed of a catalytic subunit and a constant regulatory subunit, that associates with a variety of regulatory subunits. The constant regulatory subunit A serves as a scaffolding molecule to coordinate the assembly of the catalytic subunit and a variable regulatory B subunit. This gene encodes a beta isoform of the constant regulatory subunit A. Mutations in this gene have been associated with some lung and colon cancers. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described.","Variant counts

Summary
6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase is the second dehydrogenase in the pentose phosphate shunt. Deficiency of this enzyme is generally asymptomatic, and the inheritance of this disorder is autosomal dominant. Hemolysis results from combined deficiency of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconolactonase suggesting a synergism of the two enzymopathies. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes an aspartic proteinase that belongs to the peptidase family A1. The encoded protein is a digestive enzyme that is produced in the stomach and constitutes a major component of the gastric mucosa. This protein is also secreted into the serum. This protein is synthesized as an inactive zymogen that includes a highly basic prosegment. This enzyme is converted into its active mature form at low pH by sequential cleavage of the prosegment that is carried out by the enzyme itself. Polymorphisms in this gene are associated with susceptibility to gastric cancers. Serum levels of this enzyme are used as a biomarker for certain gastric diseases including Helicobacter pylori related gastritis. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants. A pseudogene of this gene is found on chromosome 1.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the steroid receptor superfamily. The encoded protein mediates the physiological effects of progesterone, which plays a central role in reproductive events associated with the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy. This gene uses two distinct promotors and translation start sites in the first exon to produce several transcript variants, both protein coding and non-protein coding. Two of the isoforms (A and B) are identical except for an additional 165 amino acids found in the N-terminus of isoform B and mediate their own response genes and physiologic effects with little overlap.","Variant counts

Alpha-CPs play important roles in post-transcriptional activities and have different cellular distributions. This gene is induced by the p53 tumor suppressor, and the encoded protein can suppress cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in G(2)-M. This gene's protein is found in the cytoplasm, yet it lacks the nuclear localization signals found in other subfamily members. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described, but the full-length nature for only some has been determined.","Variant counts
The variants found in rare patients tested by 3billion are classified and counted according to ACMG guidelines. The variants with over 5% variant frequency in population genome databases ( gnomAD, dbSNP, etc) are excluded.

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene appears to be multifunctional. Along with PCBP-1 and hnRNPK, it is one of the major cellular poly(rC)-binding proteins. The encoded protein contains three K-homologous (KH) domains which may be involved in RNA binding. Together with PCBP-1, this protein also functions as a translational coactivator of poliovirus RNA via a sequence-specific interaction with stem-loop IV of the IRES, promoting poliovirus RNA replication by binding to its 5'-terminal cloverleaf structure. It has also been implicated in translational control of the 15-lipoxygenase mRNA, human papillomavirus type 16 L2 mRNA, and hepatitis A virus RNA. The encoded protein is also suggested to play a part in formation of a sequence-specific alpha-globin mRNP complex which is associated with alpha-globin mRNA stability. This multiexon structural mRNA is thought to be retrotransposed to generate PCBP-1, an intronless gene with functions similar to that of PCBP2. This gene and PCBP-1 have paralogous genes (PCBP3 and PCBP4) which are thought to have arisen as a result of duplication events of entire genes. This gene also has two processed pseudogenes (PCBP2P1 and PCBP2P2). Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The p21 activated kinases (PAK) are critical effectors that link Rho GTPases to cytoskeleton reorganization and nuclear signaling. The PAK proteins are a family of serine/threonine kinases that serve as targets for the small GTP binding proteins, CDC42 and RAC1, and have been implicated in a wide range of biological activities. The protein encoded by this gene is activated by proteolytic cleavage during caspase-mediated apoptosis, and may play a role in regulating the apoptotic events in the dying cell.","Variant counts

Calcium binding is important for homodimerization and for conformational changes required for binding to other protein partners. This gene product participates in T cell receptor-, Fas-, and glucocorticoid-induced programmed cell death. In mice deficient for this gene product, however, apoptosis was not blocked suggesting this gene product is functionally redundant. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene, and a pseudogene of this gene is also located on the short arm of chromosome 5.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein with a proline-rich domain. This gene is located in a region of chromosome 22 reported to contain a tumor suppressor gene that may be involved in breast and colorectal tumorigenesis. The protein is a component of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2), and it regulates platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor beta expression and PDGF signaling to Akt and S6K1. Alternative splicing and the use of alternative promoters results in transcripts encoding different isoforms. Read-through transcripts from this gene into the downstream Rho GTPase activating protein 8 (ARHGAP8) gene also exist, which led to the original description of PRR5 and ARHGAP8 being a single gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The 26S proteasome is a multicatalytic proteinase complex with a highly ordered structure composed of 2 complexes, a 20S core and a 19S regulator. The 20S core is composed of 4 rings of 28 non-identical subunits; 2 rings are composed of 7 alpha subunits and 2 rings are composed of 7 beta subunits. The 19S regulator is composed of a base, which contains 6 ATPase subunits and 2 non-ATPase subunits, and a lid, which contains up to 10 non-ATPase subunits. Proteasomes are distributed throughout eukaryotic cells at a high concentration and cleave peptides in an ATP/ubiquitin-dependent process in a non-lysosomal pathway. An essential function of a modified proteasome, the immunoproteasome, is the processing of class I MHC peptides. The immunoproteasome contains an alternate regulator, referred to as the 11S regulator or PA28, that replaces the 19S regulator. Three subunits (alpha, beta and gamma) of the 11S regulator have been identified. This gene encodes the beta subunit of the 11S regulator, one of the two 11S subunits that is induced by gamma-interferon. Three beta and three alpha subunits combine to form a heterohexameric ring. Six pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes 4, 5, 8, 10 and 13.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a poly(A) binding protein. The protein shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm and binds to the 3' poly(A) tail of eukaryotic messenger RNAs via RNA-recognition motifs. The binding of this protein to poly(A) promotes ribosome recruitment and translation initiation; it is also required for poly(A) shortening which is the first step in mRNA decay. The gene is part of a small gene family including three protein-coding genes and several pseudogenes.","Variant counts

Summary
Poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs) bind to the poly(A) tail present at the 3-prime ends of most eukaryotic mRNAs. PABPC4 or IPABP (inducible PABP) was isolated as an activation-induced T-cell mRNA encoding a protein. Activation of T cells increased PABPC4 mRNA levels in T cells approximately 5-fold. PABPC4 contains 4 RNA-binding domains and proline-rich C terminus. PABPC4 is localized primarily to the cytoplasm. It is suggested that PABPC4 might be necessary for regulation of stability of labile mRNA species in activated T cells. PABPC4 was also identified as an antigen, APP1 (activated-platelet protein-1), expressed on thrombin-activated rabbit platelets. PABPC4 may also be involved in the regulation of protein translation in platelets and megakaryocytes or may participate in the binding or stabilization of polyadenylates in platelet dense granules. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that binds to the polyA tail found at the 3' end of most eukaryotic mRNAs. It is thought to play a role in the regulation of mRNA metabolic processes in the cytoplasm. This gene is located in a gene-poor region within the X-specific 13d-sY43 subinterval of the chromosome Xq21.3/Yp11.2 homology block. It is located close to translocation breakpoints associated with premature ovarian failure, and is therefore a potential candidate gene for this disorder.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein with sequence similarity to receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatases. However, tyrosine phosphatase activity has not been experimentally validated for this protein. Studies of the rat ortholog suggest that the encoded protein may instead function as a phosphatidylinositol phosphatase with the ability to dephosphorylate phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate, and this function may be involved in the regulation of insulin secretion. This protein has been identified as an autoantigen in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a main control point for the regulation of gluconeogenesis. The cytosolic enzyme encoded by this gene, along with GTP, catalyzes the formation of phosphoenolpyruvate from oxaloacetate, with the release of carbon dioxide and GDP. The expression of this gene can be regulated by insulin, glucocorticoids, glucagon, cAMP, and diet. Defects in this gene are a cause of cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase deficiency. A mitochondrial isozyme of the encoded protein also has been characterized.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the PP2C family of Ser/Thr protein phosphatases. PP2C family members are known to be negative regulators of cell stress response pathways. This phosphatase can interact with Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (PIX), and thus block the effects of p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK), a protein kinase mediating biological effects downstream of Rho GTPases. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II gamma (CAMK2G/CAMK-II) is found to be one of the substrates of this phosphatase. The overexpression of this phosphatase or CAMK2G has been shown to mediate caspase-dependent apoptosis. An alternatively spliced transcript variant has been identified, but its full-length nature has not been determined.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the PP2C family of Ser/Thr protein phosphatases. PP2C family members are known to be negative regulators of cell stress response pathways. The expression of this gene is induced in a p53-dependent manner in response to various environmental stresses. While being induced by tumor suppressor protein TP53/p53, this phosphatase negatively regulates the activity of p38 MAP kinase, MAPK/p38, through which it reduces the phosphorylation of p53, and in turn suppresses p53-mediated transcription and apoptosis. This phosphatase thus mediates a feedback regulation of p38-p53 signaling that contributes to growth inhibition and the suppression of stress induced apoptosis. This gene is located in a chromosomal region known to be amplified in breast cancer. The amplification of this gene has been detected in both breast cancer cell line and primary breast tumors, which suggests a role of this gene in cancer development.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a magnesium or manganese-requiring phosphatase that is involved in several signaling pathways. The encoded protein downregulates apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1, a protein that initiates a signaling cascade that leads to apoptosis when cells are subjected to cytotoxic stresses. This protein also is an endoplasmic reticulum transmembrane protein that helps regulate ceramide transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. Finally, this gene may be involved in adiposity since it is upregulated in adipose tissues. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is one of the three catalytic subunits of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). This broadly expressed gene encodes the alpha subunit of the PP1 complex that associates with over 200 regulatory proteins to form holoenzymes which dephosphorylate their biological targets with high specificity. PP1 is a serine/threonine specific protein phosphatase known to be involved in the regulation of a variety of cellular processes, such as cell division, glycogen metabolism, muscle contractility, protein synthesis, and HIV-1 viral transcription. Increased PP1 activity has been observed in the end stage of heart failure. Studies suggest that PP1 is an important regulator of cardiac function and that PP1 deregulation is implicated in diabetes and multiple types of cancer. Three alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Myosin light chain kinase and phosphatase (MLCP) complexes control the phosphorylation states of regulatory myosin light chains, which is crucial for muscle and intracellular movement. MLCPs typically contain a catalytic protein phosphatase 1 (PP1c) subunit, a myosin phosphatase targeting (MYPT) subunit, and another smaller subunit. The protein encoded by this gene represents an MYPT subunit, which is responsible for directing PP1c to its intended targets. However, while the phosphorylation of other MYPT members results in PP1c inactivation, phosphorylation of the encoded protein by protein kinase A results in PP1c activation.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene is membrane-associated and contains five ankyrin repeats, a protein phosphatase-1-interacting domain, and a carboxy-terminal CAAX box domain. Synthesis of the encoded protein is inhibited by transforming growth factor beta-1. The protein may bind to the membrane through its CAAX box domain and may act as a signaling molecule through interaction with protein phosphatase-1. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms that may undergo similar processing to generate mature protein.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a member of the parathyroid family of proteins. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate a protein that binds to the parathyroid hormone/parathyroid hormone-related peptide receptor and regulates blood calcium and phosphate levels. Excess production of the encoded protein, known as hyperparathyroidism, can result in hypercalcemia and kidney stones. On the other hand, defective processing of the encoded protein may lead to hypoparathyroidism, which can result in hypocalcemia and numbness. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene belongs to the protocadherin gene family, a subfamily of the cadherin superfamily. The encoded protein consists of an extracellular domain containing 7 cadherin repeats, a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail that differs from those of the classical cadherins. The gene is located in a major X/Y block of homology and its Y homolog, despite divergence leading to coding region changes, is the most closely related cadherin family member. The protein is thought to play a fundamental role in cell-cell recognition essential for the segmental development and function of the central nervous system. Disruption of this gene may be associated with developmental dyslexia. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the patatin-like phospholipase (PNPLA) family, which is characterized by the presence of a highly conserved patatin domain. PNPLA family members have diverse lipolytic and acyltransferase activities, and are key elements in lipid metabolism. While other members of this family have been well characterized, the function of this gene remained an enigma. However, recent studies show that this gene is expressed in the skin epidermal keratinocytes, and has a role in glycerophospholipid metabolism in the cutaneous barrier. Consistent with these observations, mutations in this gene are associated with ichthyosis in human (autosomal recessive congenital ichthyoses, ARCI) and dog. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes an abundant nuclear protein that binds with high affinity to nascent poly(A) tails. The protein is required for progressive and efficient polymerization of poly(A) tails at the 3' ends of eukaryotic transcripts and controls the size of the poly(A) tail to about 250 nt. At steady-state, this protein is localized in the nucleus whereas a different poly(A) binding protein is localized in the cytoplasm. This gene contains a GCG trinucleotide repeat at the 5' end of the coding region, and expansion of this repeat from the normal 6 copies to 8-13 copies leads to autosomal dominant oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) disease. Related pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes 19 and X. Read-through transcription also exists between this gene and the neighboring upstream BCL2-like 2 (BCL2L2) gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the protocadherin gamma gene cluster, one of three related clusters tandemly linked on chromosome five. These gene clusters have an immunoglobulin-like organization, suggesting that a novel mechanism may be involved in their regulation and expression. The gamma gene cluster includes 22 genes divided into 3 subfamilies. Subfamily A contains 12 genes, subfamily B contains 7 genes and 2 pseudogenes, and the more distantly related subfamily C contains 3 genes. The tandem array of 22 large, variable region exons are followed by a constant region, containing 3 exons shared by all genes in the cluster. Each variable region exon encodes the extracellular region, which includes 6 cadherin ectodomains and a transmembrane region. The constant region exons encode the common cytoplasmic region. These neural cadherin-like cell adhesion proteins most likely play a critical role in the establishment and function of specific cell-cell connections in the brain. Alternative splicing has been described for the gamma cluster genes.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is the predominant constituent of the crystalline core of the eosinophil granule. High levels of the proform of this protein are also present in placenta and pregnancy serum, where it exists as a complex with several other proteins including pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPPA), angiotensinogen (AGT), and C3dg. This protein may be involved in antiparasitic defense mechanisms as a cytotoxin and helminthotoxin, and in immune hypersensitivity reactions. The encoded protein contains a peptide that displays potent antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and fungi. It is directly implicated in epithelial cell damage, exfoliation, and bronchospasm in allergic diseases. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

The encoded protein belongs to the class I pyridine nucleotide-disulphide oxidoreductase family but lacks the C-terminal dimerization domain found in other family members and instead has a C-terminal nitrile reductase domain. It localizes to the nucleus and to striated sarcomeric compartments. Naturally occurring mutations in this gene cause early-onset myopathy with internalized nuclei and myofibrillar disorganization. A pseudogene of this gene has been defined on chromosome 11.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a cell surface tyrosine kinase receptor for members of the platelet-derived growth factor family. These growth factors are mitogens for cells of mesenchymal origin. The identity of the growth factor bound to a receptor monomer determines whether the functional receptor is a homodimer or a heterodimer, composed of both platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha and beta polypeptides. Studies suggest that this gene plays a role in organ development, wound healing, and tumor progression. Mutations in this gene have been associated with idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome, somatic and familial gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and a variety of other cancers.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase which is involved in calcium-induced regulation of ion channels and activation of the map kinase signaling pathway. The encoded protein may represent an important signaling intermediate between neuropeptide-activated receptors or neurotransmitters that increase calcium flux and the downstream signals that regulate neuronal activity. The encoded protein undergoes rapid tyrosine phosphorylation and activation in response to increases in the intracellular calcium concentration, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor activation, membrane depolarization, or protein kinase C activation. This protein has been shown to bind CRK-associated substrate, nephrocystin, GTPase regulator associated with FAK, and the SH2 domain of GRB2. The encoded protein is a member of the FAK subfamily of protein tyrosine kinases but lacks significant sequence similarity to kinases from other subfamilies. Four transcript variants encoding two different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a clathrin assembly protein, which recruits clathrin and adaptor protein complex 2 (AP2) to cell membranes at sites of coated-pit formation and clathrin-vesicle assembly. The protein may be required to determine the amount of membrane to be recycled, possibly by regulating the size of the clathrin cage. The protein is involved in AP2-dependent clathrin-mediated endocytosis at the neuromuscular junction. A chromosomal translocation t(10;11)(p13;q14) leading to the fusion of this gene and the MLLT10 gene is found in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia and malignant lymphomas. The polymorphisms of this gene are associated with the risk of Alzheimer disease. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Cell signaling pathways rely on a dynamic interaction between activating and inhibiting processes. SHP-1-mediated dephosphorylation of protein tyrosine residues is central to the regulation of several cell signaling pathways. Two types of inhibitory receptor superfamily members are immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM)-bearing receptors and their non-ITIM-bearing, activating counterparts. Control of cell signaling via SHP-1 is thought to occur through a balance between PILRalpha-mediated inhibition and PILRbeta-mediated activation. These paired immunoglobulin-like receptor genes are located in a tandem head-to-tail orientation on chromosome 7. This particular gene encodes the ITIM-bearing member of the receptor pair, which functions in the inhibitory role. Alternative splicing has been observed at this locus and three variants, each encoding a distinct isoform, are described.","Variant counts

Summary
The paired immunoglobin-like type 2 receptors consist of highly related activating and inhibitory receptors that are involved in the regulation of many aspects of the immune system. The paired immunoglobulin-like receptor genes are located in a tandem head-to-tail orientation on chromosome 7. This gene encodes the activating member of the receptor pair and contains a truncated cytoplasmic tail relative to its inhibitory counterpart (PILRA), that has a long cytoplasmic tail with immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory (ITIM) motifs. This gene is thought to have arisen from a duplication of the inhibitory PILRA gene and evolved to acquire its activating function.","Variant counts

This gene encodes platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase isoform 2, a single-subunit intracellular enzyme that catalyzes the removal of the acetyl group at the SN-2 position of platelet-activating factor (identified as 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glyceryl-3-phosphorylcholine). However, this lipase exhibits a broader substrate specificity than simply platelet activating factor. Two other isoforms of intracellular platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase exist, and both are multi-subunit enzymes. Additionally, there is a single-subunit serum isoform of this enzyme.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene is predicted to have a single transmembrane (TM)-spanning domain and multiple copies of an immunoglobulin-like plexin-transcription-factor domain. Alternative splicing results in two transcript variants encoding different isoforms. Other alternatively spliced transcripts have been described, but the full length sequences have not been determined. Several of these transcripts are predicted to encode truncated products which lack the TM and may be secreted. Mutations in this gene cause autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, also known as polycystic kidney and hepatic disease-1.","Variant counts

Summary
Presenilins, which are components of the gamma-secretase protein complex, are required for intramembranous processing of some type I transmembrane proteins, such as the Notch proteins and the beta-amyloid precursor protein. Signaling by Notch receptors mediates a wide range of developmental cell fates. Processing of the beta-amyloid precursor protein generates neurotoxic amyloid beta peptides, the major component of senile plaques associated with Alzheimer's disease. This gene encodes a protein that is required for Notch pathway signaling, and for the activity and accumulation of gamma-secretase. Mutations resulting in haploinsufficiency for this gene cause familial acne inversa-2 (ACNINV2). Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that functions within the ESCRT pathway in the abscission stage of cytokinesis, in intralumenal endosomal vesicle formation, and in enveloped virus budding. Studies using mouse cells have shown that overexpression of this protein can block apoptosis. In addition, the product of this gene binds to the product of the PDCD6 gene, a protein required for apoptosis, in a calcium-dependent manner. This gene product also binds to endophilins, proteins that regulate membrane shape during endocytosis. Overexpression of this gene product and endophilins results in cytoplasmic vacuolization, which may be partly responsible for the protection against cell death. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. Related pseudogenes have been identified on chromosome 15.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C family. Members in this family, classified into six isotypes that are tissue- and organ-specific, hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate just before the phosphate group to yield diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. This protein localizes to the acrosome in spermatozoa and elicits Ca(2+) oscillations and egg activation during fertilization that leads to early embryonic development. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is found as a pentamer and is a major substrate for the cAMP-dependent protein kinase in cardiac muscle. The encoded protein is an inhibitor of cardiac muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase in the unphosphorylated state, but inhibition is relieved upon phosphorylation of the protein. The subsequent activation of the Ca(2+) pump leads to enhanced muscle relaxation rates, thereby contributing to the inotropic response elicited in heart by beta-agonists. The encoded protein is a key regulator of cardiac diastolic function. Mutations in this gene are a cause of inherited human dilated cardiomyopathy with refractory congestive heart failure, and also familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.","Variant counts

Pseudouridination, the isomerization of uridine to pseudouridine, is the most common posttranscriptional nucleotide modification found in RNA and is essential for biologic functions such as spliceosome biogenesis. Pseudouridylate synthases, such as PUS10, catalyze pseudouridination of structural RNAs, including transfer, ribosomal, and splicing RNAs. These enzymes also act as RNA chaperones, facilitating the correct folding and assembly of tRNAs (McCleverty et al., 2007 [PubMed 17900615]).","Variant counts

Summary
A cluster of genes, BAT1-BAT5, has been localized in the vicinity of the genes for TNF alpha and TNF beta. These genes are all within the human major histocompatibility complex class III region. This gene has microsatellite repeats which are associated with the age-at-onset of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and possibly thought to be involved with the inflammatory process of pancreatic beta-cell destruction during the development of IDDM. This gene is also a candidate gene for the development of rheumatoid arthritis. Two transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the Ser/Thr protein kinase family, and PIM subfamily. This gene is expressed primarily in B-lymphoid and myeloid cell lines, and is overexpressed in hematopoietic malignancies and in prostate cancer. It plays a role in signal transduction in blood cells, contributing to both cell proliferation and survival, and thus provides a selective advantage in tumorigenesis. Both the human and orthologous mouse genes have been reported to encode two isoforms (with preferential cellular localization) resulting from the use of alternative in-frame translation initiation codons, the upstream non-AUG (CUG) and downstream AUG codons (PMIDs:16186805, 1825810).","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4-kinase which catalyzes the first committed step in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. The mammalian PI 4-kinases have been classified into two types, II and III, based on their molecular mass, and modulation by detergent and adenosine. The protein encoded by this gene is a type III enzyme that is not inhibited by adenosine. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that associates with the enzyme phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase (PRS). PRS catalyzes the formation of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate which is a substrate for synthesis of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides, histidine, tryptophan and NAD. PRS exists as a complex with two catalytic subunits and two associated subunits. This gene encodes a non-catalytic associated subunit of PRS. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The plasminogen protein encoded by this gene is a serine protease that circulates in blood plasma as an inactive zymogen and is converted to the active protease, plasmin, by several plasminogen activators such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), kallikrein, and factor XII (Hageman factor). The conversion of plasminogen to plasmin involves the cleavage of the peptide bond between Arg-561 and Val-562. Plasmin cleavage also releases the angiostatin protein which inhibits angiogenesis. Plasmin degrades many blood plasma proteins, including fibrin-containing blood clots. As a serine protease, plasmin cleaves many products in addition to fibrin such as fibronectin, thrombospondin, laminin, and von Willebrand factor. Plasmin is inactivated by proteins such as alpha-2-macroglobulin and alpha-2-antiplasmin in addition to inhibitors of the various plasminogen activators. Plasminogen also interacts with plasminogen receptors which results in the retention of plasmin on cell surfaces and in plasmin-induced cell signaling. The localization of plasminogen on cell surfaces plays a role in the degradation of extracellular matrices, cell migration, inflamation, wound healing, oncogenesis, metastasis, myogenesis, muscle regeneration, neurite outgrowth, and fibrinolysis. This protein may also play a role in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which, in part, is caused by enhanced clot formation and the suppression of fibrinolysis. Compared to other mammals, the cluster of plasminogen-like genes to which this gene belongs has been rearranged in catarrhine primates.","Variant counts
