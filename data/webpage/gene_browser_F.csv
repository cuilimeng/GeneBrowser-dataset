Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the diaphanous-related formins (DRF), and contains multiple domains, including GBD (GTPase-binding domain), DID (diaphanous inhibitory domain), FH1 (formin homology 1), FH2 (formin homology 2), and DAD (diaphanous auto-regulatory domain) domains. This protein is thought to play a role in actin filament polymerization in cardiomyocytes. Mutations in this gene have been associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), characterized by dilation of the ventricular chamber, leading to impairment of systolic pump function and subsequent heart failure. Increased levels of the protein encoded by this gene have been observed in individuals with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. A muscle-specific isoform has been shown to possess a casein kinase 2 (CK2) phosphorylation site at the C-terminal end of the FH2 domain. Phosphorylation of this site alters its interaction with sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1), and targets this isoform to myofibrils, while other isoforms form cytoplasmic aggregates.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a single stranded DNA-binding protein that binds to multiple DNA elements, including the far upstream element (FUSE) located upstream of c-myc. Binding to FUSE occurs on the non-coding strand, and is important to the regulation of c-myc in undifferentiated cells. This protein contains three domains, an amphipathic helix N-terminal domain, a DNA-binding central domain, and a C-terminal transactivation domain that contains three tyrosine-rich motifs. The N-terminal domain is thought to repress the activity of the C-terminal domain. This protein is also thought to bind RNA, and contains 3'-5' helicase activity with in vitro activity on both DNA-DNA and RNA-RNA duplexes. Aberrant expression of this gene has been found in malignant tissues, and this gene is important to neural system and lung development. Binding of this protein to viral RNA is thought to play a role in several viral diseases, including hepatitis C and hand, foot and mouth disease. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the F-box protein family which is characterized by an approximately 40 amino acid motif, the F-box. The F-box proteins constitute one of the four subunits of ubiquitin protein ligase complex called SCFs (SKP1-cullin-F-box), which function in phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination. The F-box proteins are divided into 3 classes: Fbws containing WD-40 domains, Fbls containing leucine-rich repeats, and Fbxs containing either different protein-protein interaction modules or no recognizable motifs. The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the Fbxs class. It can function as an arginine methyltransferase that symmetrically dimethylates arginine residues, and it acts as an adaptor protein to mediate the neddylation of p53, which leads to the suppression of p53 function. This gene is known to be down-regulated in melanocytes from patients with vitiligo, a skin disorder that results in depigmentation. Polymorphisms in this gene are associated with chronic otitis media with effusion and recurrent otitis media (COME/ROM), a hearing loss disorder, and the knockout of the homologous mouse gene results in the deaf mouse mutant Jeff (Jf), a single gene model of otitis media. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been identified for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the immunophilin protein family, which play a role in immunoregulation and basic cellular processes involving protein folding and trafficking. This encoded protein is a cis-trans prolyl isomerase that binds the immunosuppressants FK506 and rapamycin. It is highly similar to the FK506-binding protein 1A. Its physiological role is thought to be in excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac muscle. There are two alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the immunophilin protein family, which play a role in immunoregulation and basic cellular processes involving protein folding and trafficking. The protein is a cis-trans prolyl isomerase that binds the immunosuppressants FK506 and rapamycin. It interacts with several intracellular signal transduction proteins including type I TGF-beta receptor. It also interacts with multiple intracellular calcium release channels, and coordinates multi-protein complex formation of the tetrameric skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor. In mouse, deletion of this homologous gene causes congenital heart disorder known as noncompaction of left ventricular myocardium. Multiple alternatively spliced variants, encoding the same protein, have been identified. The human genome contains five pseudogenes related to this gene, at least one of which is transcribed.","Variant counts

The encoded type I transmembrane protein has an extracellular region consisting of an N-terminal leucine-rich repeat domain and a type 3 fibronectin domain, followed by a transmembrane domain and a short C-terminal cytoplasmic tail domain. It functions as both a homophilic cell adhesion molecule and a heterophilic chemorepellent through its interaction with members of the uncoordinated-5 receptor family. Proteolytic removal of the extracellular region controls the migration of neurons in the developing cortex. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

In addition to containing 34 tandem cadherin-type repeats, the gene product has five epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats and one laminin A-G domain. This gene is expressed at high levels in a number of fetal epithelia. Its product probably functions as an adhesion molecule and/or signaling receptor, and is likely to be important in developmental processes and cell communication. Transcript variants derived from alternative splicing and/or alternative promoter usage exist, but they have not been fully described.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the protocadherin family. This gene may play a role in regulating planar cell polarity (PCP). Studies in mice suggest that loss of PCP signaling may cause cystic kidney disease, and mutations in this gene have been associated with Van Maldergem Syndrome 2. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been noted for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the fibrillin family of proteins. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate two proteins including the extracellular matrix component fibrillin-1 and the protein hormone asprosin. Fibrillin-1 is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein that serves as a structural component of calcium-binding microfibrils. These microfibrils provide force-bearing structural support in elastic and nonelastic connective tissue throughout the body. Asprosin, secreted by white adipose tissue, has been shown to regulate glucose homeostasis. Mutations in this gene are associated with Marfan syndrome and the related MASS phenotype, as well as ectopia lentis syndrome, Weill-Marchesani syndrome, Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome and neonatal progeroid syndrome.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a ubiquitin ligase that is a member of the Fanconi anemia complementation group (FANC). Members of this group are related by their assembly into a common nuclear protein complex rather than by sequence similarity. This gene encodes the protein for complementation group L that mediates monoubiquitination of FANCD2 as well as FANCI. Fanconi anemia is a genetically heterogeneous recessive disorder characterized by cytogenetic instability, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, increased chromosomal breakage, and defective DNA repair. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The Fanconi anemia complementation group (FANC) currently includes FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1 (also called BRCA2), FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCI, FANCJ (also called BRIP1), FANCL, FANCM and FANCN (also called PALB2). The previously defined group FANCH is the same as FANCA. Fanconi anemia is a genetically heterogeneous recessive disorder characterized by cytogenetic instability, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, increased chromosomal breakage, and defective DNA repair. The members of the Fanconi anemia complementation group do not share sequence similarity; they are related by their assembly into a common nuclear protein complex. This gene encodes the protein for complementation group I. Alternative splicing results in two transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes coagulation factor XIII B subunit. Coagulation factor XIII is the last zymogen to become activated in the blood coagulation cascade. Plasma factor XIII is a heterotetramer composed of 2 A subunits and 2 B subunits. The A subunits have catalytic function, and the B subunits do not have enzymatic activity and may serve as a plasma carrier molecules. Platelet factor XIII is comprised only of 2 A subunits, which are identical to those of plasma origin. Upon activation by the cleavage of the activation peptide by thrombin and in the presence of calcium ion, the plasma factor XIII dissociates its B subunits and yields the same active enzyme, factor XIIIa, as platelet factor XIII. This enzyme acts as a transglutaminase to catalyze the formation of gamma-glutamyl-epsilon-lysine crosslinking between fibrin molecules, thus stabilizing the fibrin clot. Factor XIII deficiency is classified into two categories: type I deficiency, characterized by the lack of both the A and B subunits; and type II deficiency, characterized by the lack of the A subunit alone. These defects can result in a lifelong bleeding tendency, defective wound healing, and habitual abortion.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein similar to receptors for the Fc fragment of gamma immunoglobulin (IgG). These receptors, referred to as FCGRs, mediate the destruction of IgG-coated antigens and of cells induced by antibodies. This encoded protein is selectively expressed in B cells, and may be involved in their development. This protein may also be involved in the development of lymphomas. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants that encode different protein isoforms have been described for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family. FGF family members possess broad mitogenic and cell survival activities, and are involved in a variety of biological processes, including embryonic development, cell growth, morphogenesis, tissue repair, tumor growth and invasion. This protein functions as a modifier of endothelial cell migration and proliferation, as well as an angiogenic factor. It acts as a mitogen for a variety of mesoderm- and neuroectoderm-derived cells in vitro, thus is thought to be involved in organogenesis. Multiple alternatively spliced variants encoding different isoforms have been described.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the Src family of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs). The encoded protein contains N-terminal sites for myristylation and palmitylation, a PTK domain, and SH2 and SH3 domains which are involved in mediating protein-protein interactions with phosphotyrosine-containing and proline-rich motifs, respectively. The protein localizes to plasma membrane ruffles, and functions as a negative regulator of cell migration and adhesion triggered by the beta-2 integrin signal transduction pathway. Infection with Epstein-Barr virus results in the overexpression of this gene. Multiple alternatively spliced variants, encoding the same protein, have been identified.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is the gamma component of fibrinogen, a blood-borne glycoprotein comprised of three pairs of nonidentical polypeptide chains. Following vascular injury, fibrinogen is cleaved by thrombin to form fibrin which is the most abundant component of blood clots. In addition, various cleavage products of fibrinogen and fibrin regulate cell adhesion and spreading, display vasoconstrictor and chemotactic activities, and are mitogens for several cell types. Mutations in this gene lead to several disorders, including dysfibrinogenemia, hypofibrinogenemia and thrombophilia. Alternative splicing results in transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes the alpha subunit of the coagulation factor fibrinogen, which is a component of the blood clot. Following vascular injury, the encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed by thrombin during the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. Mutations in this gene lead to several disorders, including dysfibrinogenemia, hypofibrinogenemia, afibrinogenemia and renal amyloidosis. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, at least one of which encodes an isoform that undergoes proteolytic processing.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is cell-cycle regulated, and has nuclear localization. The C-terminal half of the protein shares homology with trypsin-like peptidases and it contains a PCNA-interacting peptide (PIP) box, that is necessary for its co-localization with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Reduced expression of this gene resulted in DNA replication defects, consistent with the demonstrated role for this gene in Simian Virus 40 (SV40) viral replication. Mutations in this gene have been associated with Kenny-Caffey syndrome (KCS) type 2 and the more severe osteocraniostenosis (OCS, also known as Gracile Bone Dysplasia), both characterized by short stature, hypoparathyroidism, bone development abnormalities, and hypocalcemia. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The pituitary glycoprotein hormone family includes follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, chorionic gonadotropin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone. All of these glycoproteins consist of an identical alpha subunit and a hormone-specific beta subunit. This gene encodes the beta subunit of follicle-stimulating hormone. In conjunction with luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone induces egg and sperm production. Alternative splicing results in two transcript variants encoding the same protein.","Variant counts

The F-box proteins constitute one of the four subunits of the ubiquitin protein ligase complex called SCFs (SKP1-cullin-F-box), which function in phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination. The F-box proteins are divided into 3 classes: Fbws containing WD-40 domains, Fbls containing leucine-rich repeats, and Fbxs containing either different protein-protein interaction modules or no recognizable motifs. The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the Fbxs class. It is also a member of the NFB42 (neural F Box 42 kDa) family, similar to F-box only protein 2 and F-box only protein 6. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding two distinct isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Fibrinogen-like 1 is a member of the fibrinogen family. This protein is homologous to the carboxy terminus of the fibrinogen beta- and gamma- subunits which contains the four conserved cysteines of fibrinogens and fibrinogen related proteins. However, this protein lacks the platelet-binding site, cross-linking region and a thrombin-sensitive site which are necessary for fibrin clot formation. This protein may play a role in the development of hepatocellular carcinomas. Four alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein exist for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is an adaptor molecule that interacts with various cell surface receptors and mediates cell apoptotic signals. Through its C-terminal death domain, this protein can be recruited by TNFRSF6/Fas-receptor, tumor necrosis factor receptor, TNFRSF25, and TNFSF10/TRAIL-receptor, and thus it participates in the death signaling initiated by these receptors. Interaction of this protein with the receptors unmasks the N-terminal effector domain of this protein, which allows it to recruit caspase-8, and thereby activate the cysteine protease cascade. Knockout studies in mice also suggest the importance of this protein in early T cell development.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene removes 5' overhanging flaps in DNA repair and processes the 5' ends of Okazaki fragments in lagging strand DNA synthesis. Direct physical interaction between this protein and AP endonuclease 1 during long-patch base excision repair provides coordinated loading of the proteins onto the substrate, thus passing the substrate from one enzyme to another. The protein is a member of the XPG/RAD2 endonuclease family and is one of ten proteins essential for cell-free DNA replication. DNA secondary structure can inhibit flap processing at certain trinucleotide repeats in a length-dependent manner by concealing the 5' end of the flap that is necessary for both binding and cleavage by the protein encoded by this gene. Therefore, secondary structure can deter the protective function of this protein, leading to site-specific trinucleotide expansions.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes coagulation factor XII which circulates in blood as a zymogen. This single chain zymogen is converted to a two-chain serine protease with an heavy chain (alpha-factor XIIa) and a light chain. The heavy chain contains two fibronectin-type domains, two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, a kringle domain and a proline-rich domain, whereas the light chain contains only a catalytic domain. On activation, further cleavages takes place in the heavy chain, resulting in the production of beta-factor XIIa light chain and the alpha-factor XIIa light chain becomes beta-factor XIIa heavy chain. Prekallikrein is cleaved by factor XII to form kallikrein, which then cleaves factor XII first to alpha-factor XIIa and then to beta-factor XIIa. The active factor XIIa participates in the initiation of blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, and the generation of bradykinin and angiotensin. It activates coagulation factors VII and XI. Defects in this gene do not cause any clinical symptoms and the sole effect is that whole-blood clotting time is prolonged.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor X of the blood coagulation cascade. This factor undergoes multiple processing steps before its preproprotein is converted to a mature two-chain form by the excision of the tripeptide RKR. Two chains of the factor are held together by 1 or more disulfide bonds; the light chain contains 2 EGF-like domains, while the heavy chain contains the catalytic domain which is structurally homologous to those of the other hemostatic serine proteases. The mature factor is activated by the cleavage of the activation peptide by factor IXa (in the intrisic pathway), or by factor VIIa (in the extrinsic pathway). The activated factor then converts prothrombin to thrombin in the presence of factor Va, Ca+2, and phospholipid during blood clotting. Mutations of this gene result in factor X deficiency, a hemorrhagic condition of variable severity. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms that may undergo similar proteolytic processing to generate mature polypeptides.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes coagulation factor XI of the blood coagulation cascade. This protein is present in plasma as a zymogen, which is a unique plasma coagulation enzyme because it exists as a homodimer consisting of two identical polypeptide chains linked by disulfide bonds. During activation of the plasma factor XI, an internal peptide bond is cleaved by factor XIIa (or XII) in each of the two chains, resulting in activated factor XIa, a serine protease composed of two heavy and two light chains held together by disulfide bonds. This activated plasma factor XI triggers the middle phase of the intrisic pathway of blood coagulation by activating factor IX. Defects in this factor lead to Rosenthal syndrome, a blood coagulation abnormality.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes one of three related filamin genes, specifically gamma filamin. These filamin proteins crosslink actin filaments into orthogonal networks in cortical cytoplasm and participate in the anchoring of membrane proteins for the actin cytoskeleton. Three functional domains exist in filamin: an N-terminal filamentous actin-binding domain, a C-terminal self-association domain, and a membrane glycoprotein-binding domain. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the F-box protein family which is characterized by an approximately 40 amino acid motif, the F-box. The F-box proteins constitute one of the four subunits of the ubiquitin protein ligase complex called SCFs (SKP1-cullin-F-box), which function in phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination. The F-box proteins are divided into 3 classes: Fbws containing WD-40 domains, Fbls containing leucine-rich repeats, and Fbxs containing either different protein-protein interaction modules or no recognizable motifs. The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the Fbxs class and it is upregulated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the F-box family. Members are classified into three classes according to the substrate interaction domain, FBW for WD40 repeats, FBL for leucing-rich repeats, and FBXO for other domains. This protein, classified into the last category because of the lack of a recognizable substrate binding domain, has been proposed to be a component of the SCF ubiquitination complex. It is thought to bind and recruit substrate for ubiquitination and degradation. This protein may have a role in regulating the cell cycle as well as dendrite growth and neuronal migration. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the F-box protein family which is characterized by an approximately 40 amino acid motif, the F-box. The F-box proteins constitute one of the four subunits of the ubiquitin protein ligase complex called SCFs (SKP1-cullin-F-box), which function in phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination. The F-box proteins are divided into 3 classes: Fbws containing WD-40 domains, Fbls containing leucine-rich repeats, and Fbxs containing either different protein-protein interaction modules or no recognizable motifs. The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the Fbxs class and contains an F-box domain. This protein is highly expressed during muscle atrophy, whereas mice deficient in this gene were found to be resistant to atrophy. This protein is thus a potential drug target for the treatment of muscle atrophy. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
Members of the F-box protein family, such as FBXO39, are characterized by an approximately 40-amino acid F-box motif. SCF complexes, formed by SKP1 (MIM 601434), cullin (see CUL1; MIM 603134), and F-box proteins, act as protein-ubiquitin ligases. F-box proteins interact with SKP1 through the F box, and they interact with ubiquitination targets through other protein interaction domains (Jin et al., 2004 [PubMed 15520277]).","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a fatty acid amide hydrolase that shares a conserved protein motif with the amidase signature family of enzymes. The encoded enzyme is able to catalyze the hydrolysis of a broad range of bioactive lipids, including those from the three main classes of fatty acid amides; N-acylethanolamines, fatty acid primary amides and N-acyl amino acids. This enzyme has a preference for monounsaturated acyl chains as a substrate. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.","Variant counts

F-box proteins constitute one subunit of modular E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, called SCF complexes, which function in phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination. The F-box domain mediates protein-protein interactions and binds directly to S-phase kinase-associated protein 1. In addition to an F-box domain, the encoded protein contains at least 9 tandem leucine-rich repeats. The ubiquitin ligase complex containing the encoded protein may function in cell-cycle control by regulating levels of lysine-specific demethylase 4A. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
Ficolins are a group of proteins which consist of a collagen-like domain and a fibrinogen-like domain. In human serum, there are two types of ficolins, both of which have lectin activity. The protein encoded by this gene is a thermolabile beta-2-macroglycoprotein found in all human serum and is a member of the ficolin/opsonin p35 lectin family. The protein, which was initially identified based on its reactivity with sera from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, has been shown to have a calcium-independent lectin activity. The protein can activate the complement pathway in association with MASPs and sMAP, thereby aiding in host defense through the activation of the lectin pathway. Alternative splicing occurs at this locus and two variants, each encoding a distinct isoform, have been identified.","Variant counts

This family is characterized by the presence of a leader peptide, a short N-terminal segment, followed by a collagen-like region, and a C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain. This gene is predominantly expressed in the liver, and has been shown to have carbohydrate binding and opsonic activities. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified.","Variant counts

Summary
The ficolin family of proteins are characterized by the presence of a leader peptide, a short N-terminal segment, followed by a collagen-like region, and a C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain. The collagen-like and the fibrinogen-like domains are also found separately in other proteins such as complement protein C1q, C-type lectins known as collectins, and tenascins. However, all these proteins recognize different targets, and are functionally distinct. Ficolin 1 encoded by FCN1 is predominantly expressed in the peripheral blood leukocytes, and has been postulated to function as a plasma protein with elastin-binding activity.","Variant counts

Summary
This intronless gene is a member of the frizzled gene family. Members of this family encode seven-transmembrane domain proteins that are receptors for the wingless type MMTV integration site family of signaling proteins. This gene encodes a protein that is coupled to the beta-catenin canonical signaling pathway. Competition between the wingless-type MMTV integration site family, member 3A and wingless-type MMTV integration site family, member 5A gene products for binding of this protein is thought to regulate the beta-catenin-dependent and -independent pathways.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the frizzled gene family. Members of this family encode seven-transmembrane domain proteins that are receptors for the wingless type MMTV integration site family of signaling proteins. Most frizzled receptors are coupled to the beta-catenin canonical signaling pathway. The function of this protein is unknown, although it may play a role in mammalian hair follicle development. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. This gene is a susceptibility locus for schizophrenia.","Variant counts

Members of this family encode seven-transmembrane domain proteins that are receptors for the Wingless type MMTV integration site family of signaling proteins. Most frizzled receptors are coupled to the beta-catenin canonical signaling pathway. This protein may play a role as a positive regulator of the Wingless type MMTV integration site signaling pathway. A transcript variant retaining intronic sequence and encoding a shorter isoform has been described, however, its expression is not supported by other experimental evidence.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene represents a member of the 'frizzled' gene family, which encode 7-transmembrane domain proteins that are receptors for Wnt signaling proteins. The protein encoded by this family member contains a signal peptide, a cysteine-rich domain in the N-terminal extracellular region, and seven transmembrane domains, but unlike other family members, this protein does not contain a C-terminal PDZ domain-binding motif. This protein functions as a negative regulator of the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling cascade, thereby inhibiting the processes that trigger oncogenic transformation, cell proliferation, and inhibition of apoptosis. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, some of which do not encode a protein with a predicted signal peptide.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the fatty acid desaturase (FADS) gene family. Desaturase enzymes regulate unsaturation of fatty acids through the introduction of double bonds between defined carbons of the fatty acyl chain. FADS family members are considered fusion products composed of an N-terminal cytochrome b5-like domain and a C-terminal multiple membrane-spanning desaturase portion, both of which are characterized by conserved histidine motifs. This gene is clustered with family members FADS1 and FADS2 at 11q12-q13.1; this cluster is thought to have arisen evolutionarily from gene duplication based on its similar exon/intron organization.","Variant counts

Summary
The Lewis histo-blood group system comprises a set of fucosylated glycosphingolipids that are synthesized by exocrine epithelial cells and circulate in body fluids. The glycosphingolipids function in embryogenesis, tissue differentiation, tumor metastasis, inflammation, and bacterial adhesion. They are secondarily absorbed to red blood cells giving rise to their Lewis phenotype. This gene is a member of the fucosyltransferase family, which catalyzes the addition of fucose to precursor polysaccharides in the last step of Lewis antigen biosynthesis. It encodes an enzyme with alpha(1,3)-fucosyltransferase and alpha(1,4)-fucosyltransferase activities. Mutations in this gene are responsible for the majority of Lewis antigen-negative phenotypes. Differences in the expression of this gene are associated with host susceptibility to viral infection.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the glycosyltransferase family. It is localized to the golgi, and catalyzes the last step in the biosynthesis of Lewis X (LeX) antigen, the addition of a fucose to precursor polysaccharides. This protein is one of the few fucosyltransferases that synthesizes the LeX oligosaccharide (CD15) expressed in the organ buds progressing in mesenchyma during embryogenesis. It is also responsible for the expression of CD15 in mature granulocytes. A common haplotype of this gene has also been associated with susceptibility to placental malaria infection.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes the coagulation factor XIII A subunit. Coagulation factor XIII is the last zymogen to become activated in the blood coagulation cascade. Plasma factor XIII is a heterotetramer composed of 2 A subunits and 2 B subunits. The A subunits have catalytic function, and the B subunits do not have enzymatic activity and may serve as plasma carrier molecules. Platelet factor XIII is comprised only of 2 A subunits, which are identical to those of plasma origin. Upon cleavage of the activation peptide by thrombin and in the presence of calcium ion, the plasma factor XIII dissociates its B subunits and yields the same active enzyme, factor XIIIa, as platelet factor XIII. This enzyme acts as a transglutaminase to catalyze the formation of gamma-glutamyl-epsilon-lysine crosslinking between fibrin molecules, thus stabilizing the fibrin clot. It also crosslinks alpha-2-plasmin inhibitor, or fibronectin, to the alpha chains of fibrin. Factor XIII deficiency is classified into two categories: type I deficiency, characterized by the lack of both the A and B subunits; and type II deficiency, characterized by the lack of the A subunit alone. These defects can result in a lifelong bleeding tendency, defective wound healing, and habitual abortion.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the forkhead/winged-helix (FOX) family of transcription factors. It is expressed in fetal and adult brain as well as in several other organs such as the lung and gut. The protein product contains a FOX DNA-binding domain and a large polyglutamine tract and is an evolutionarily conserved transcription factor, which may bind directly to approximately 300 to 400 gene promoters in the human genome to regulate the expression of a variety of genes. This gene is required for proper development of speech and language regions of the brain during embryogenesis, and may be involved in a variety of biological pathways and cascades that may ultimately influence language development. Mutations in this gene cause speech-language disorder 1 (SPCH1), also known as autosomal dominant speech and language disorder with orofacial dyspraxia. Multiple alternative transcripts encoding different isoforms have been identified in this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a peripheral membrane protein and is located in a region of chromosome 10q that contains a segmental duplication. This copy of the gene is full-length and is in the telomeric duplicated region. Two other more centromerically proximal copies of the gene are partial and may represent pseudogenes. This full-length gene appears to function in the establishment and maintenance of cell polarization. The protein is recruited to cell-cell junctions in an E-cadherin-dependent manner, and is selectively localized at the basolateral membrane in polarized epithelial cells. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

This gene (FCGR3A) is highly similar to another nearby gene (FCGR3B) located on chromosome 1. The receptor encoded by this gene is expressed on natural killer (NK) cells as an integral membrane glycoprotein anchored through a transmembrane peptide, whereas FCGR3B is expressed on polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) where the receptor is anchored through a phosphatidylinositol (PI) linkage. Mutations in this gene are associated with immunodeficiency 20, and have been linked to susceptibility to recurrent viral infections, susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus, and alloimmune neonatal neutropenia. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts
The variants found in rare patients tested by 3billion are classified and counted according to ACMG guidelines. The variants with over 5% variant frequency in population genome databases ( gnomAD, dbSNP, etc) are excluded.

This reference sequence was derived from multiple replicate ESTs and validated by similar human genomic sequence. This gene encodes a member of a family of small membrane proteins that share a 35-amino acid signature sequence domain, beginning with the sequence PFXYD and containing 7 invariant and 6 highly conserved amino acids. The approved human gene nomenclature for the family is FXYD-domain containing ion transport regulator. Transmembrane topology has been established for two family members (FXYD1 and FXYD2), with the N-terminus extracellular and the C-terminus on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. FXYD2, also known as the gamma subunit of the Na,K-ATPase, regulates the properties of that enzyme. FXYD1 (phospholemman), FXYD2 (gamma), FXYD3 (MAT-8), FXYD4 (CHIF), and FXYD5 (RIC) have been shown to induce channel activity in experimental expression systems. This gene product, FXYD7, is novel and has not been characterized as a protein.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a class III receptor tyrosine kinase that regulates hematopoiesis. This receptor is activated by binding of the fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand to the extracellular domain, which induces homodimer formation in the plasma membrane leading to autophosphorylation of the receptor. The activated receptor kinase subsequently phosphorylates and activates multiple cytoplasmic effector molecules in pathways involved in apoptosis, proliferation, and differentiation of hematopoietic cells in bone marrow. Mutations that result in the constitutive activation of this receptor result in acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) family. VEGFR family members are receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) which contain an extracellular ligand-binding region with seven immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains, a transmembrane segment, and a tyrosine kinase (TK) domain within the cytoplasmic domain. This protein binds to VEGFR-A, VEGFR-B and placental growth factor and plays an important role in angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. Expression of this receptor is found in vascular endothelial cells, placental trophoblast cells and peripheral blood monocytes. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. Isoforms include a full-length transmembrane receptor isoform and shortened, soluble isoforms. The soluble isoforms are associated with the onset of pre-eclampsia.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family. FGF family members possess broad mitogenic and cell survival activities, and are involved in a variety of biological processes, including embryonic development, cell growth, morphogenesis, tissue repair, tumor growth and invasion. This protein was isolated as a secreted factor that exhibits a growth-stimulating effect on cultured glial cells. In nervous system, this protein is produced mainly by neurons and may be important for glial cell development. Expression of the mouse homolog of this gene was found to be dependent on Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling. Mice lacking the homolog gene displayed a male-to-female sex reversal phenotype, which suggested a role in testicular embryogenesis.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a type II transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the M28 peptidase family. The protein acts as a glutamate carboxypeptidase on different alternative substrates, including the nutrient folate and the neuropeptide N-acetyl-l-aspartyl-l-glutamate and is expressed in a number of tissues such as prostate, central and peripheral nervous system and kidney. A mutation in this gene may be associated with impaired intestinal absorption of dietary folates, resulting in low blood folate levels and consequent hyperhomocysteinemia. Expression of this protein in the brain may be involved in a number of pathological conditions associated with glutamate excitotoxicity. In the prostate the protein is up-regulated in cancerous cells and is used as an effective diagnostic and prognostic indicator of prostate cancer. This gene likely arose from a duplication event of a nearby chromosomal region. Alternative splicing gives rise to multiple transcript variants encoding several different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of a family of proteins that contain an approximately 40-amino acid F-box motif. This motif is important for interaction with SKP1 and for targeting some proteins for degradation. The encoded protein has been shown to control the cellular level of FBXL7, a protein that induces mitotic arrest, by targeting it for polyubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. Members of the F-box protein family, such as FBXL18, are characterized by an approximately 40-amino acid F-box motif. F-box proteins interact with SKP1 through the F box, and they interact with ubiquitination targets through other protein interaction domains.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes fibronectin, a glycoprotein present in a soluble dimeric form in plasma, and in a dimeric or multimeric form at the cell surface and in extracellular matrix. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate the mature protein. Fibronectin is involved in cell adhesion and migration processes including embryogenesis, wound healing, blood coagulation, host defense, and metastasis. The gene has three regions subject to alternative splicing, with the potential to produce 20 different transcript variants, at least one of which encodes an isoform that undergoes proteolytic processing. The full-length nature of some variants has not been determined.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein with an N-terminal filamin-binding domain, a central proline-rich domain, and, multiple C-terminal LIM domains. This protein localizes at cell junctions and may link cell adhesion structures to the actin cytoskeleton. This protein may be involved in the assembly and stabilization of actin-filaments and likely plays a role in modulating cell adhesion, cell morphology and cell motility. This protein also localizes to the nucleus and may affect cardiomyocyte differentiation after binding with the CSX/NKX2-5 transcription factor. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Follistatin is a single-chain gonadal protein that specifically inhibits follicle-stimulating hormone release. The single FST gene encodes two isoforms, FST317 and FST344 containing 317 and 344 amino acids respectively, resulting from alternative splicing of the precursor mRNA. In a study in which 37 candidate genes were tested for linkage and association with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or hyperandrogenemia in 150 families, evidence was found for linkage between PCOS and follistatin.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes the prothrombin protein (also known as coagulation factor II). This protein is proteolytically cleaved in multiple steps to form the activated serine protease thrombin. The activated thrombin enzyme plays an important role in thrombosis and hemostasis by converting fibrinogen to fibrin during blood clot formation, by stimulating platelet aggregation, and by activating additional coagulation factors. Thrombin also plays a role in cell proliferation, tissue repair, and angiogenesis as well as maintaining vascular integrity during development and postnatal life. Peptides derived from the C-terminus of this protein have antimicrobial activity against E. coli and P. aeruginosa. Mutations in this gene lead to various forms of thrombosis and dysprothrombinemia. Rapid increases in cytokine levels following coronavirus infections can dysregulate the coagulation cascade and produce thrombosis, compromised blood supply, and organ failure.","Variant counts

Summary
F-box proteins are an expanding family of eukaryotic proteins characterized by an approximately 40 amino acid motif, the F box. Some F-box proteins have been shown to be critical for the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of cellular regulatory proteins. In fact, F-box proteins are one of the four subunits of ubiquitin protein ligases, called SCFs. SCF ligases bring ubiquitin conjugating enzymes to substrates that are specifically recruited by the different F-box proteins. Mammalian F-box proteins are classified into three groups based on the presence of either WD-40 repeats, leucine-rich repeats, or the presence or absence of other protein-protein interacting domains. This gene encodes the second identified member of the F-box gene family and contains multiple WD-40 repeats.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the F-box/WD-40 gene family, which recruit specific target proteins through their WD-40 protein-protein binding domains for ubiquitin mediated degradation. In mouse, a highly similar protein is thought to be responsible for maintaining the apical ectodermal ridge of developing limb buds; disruption of the mouse gene results in the absence of central digits, underdeveloped or absent metacarpal/metatarsal bones and syndactyly. This phenotype is remarkably similar to split hand-split foot malformation in humans, a clinically heterogeneous condition with a variety of modes of transmission. An autosomal recessive form has been mapped to the chromosomal region where this gene is located, and complex rearrangements involving duplications of this gene and others have been associated with the condition. A pseudogene of this locus has been mapped to one of the introns of the BCR gene on chromosome 22.","Variant counts

The F-box proteins are divided into 3 classes: Fbws containing WD-40 domains, Fbls containing leucine-rich repeats, and Fbxs containing either different protein-protein interaction modules or no recognizable motifs. The protein encoded by this gene was previously referred to as FBX30, and belongs to the Fbws class; in addition to an F-box, this protein contains 7 tandem WD40 repeats. This protein binds directly to cyclin E and probably targets cyclin E for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Mutations in this gene are detected in ovarian and breast cancer cell lines, implicating the gene's potential role in the pathogenesis of human cancers. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a member of the fascin family of actin-binding proteins. Fascin proteins organize F-actin into parallel bundles, and are required for the formation of actin-based cellular protrusions. The encoded protein plays a critical role in cell migration, motility, adhesion and cellular interactions. Expression of this gene is known to be regulated by several microRNAs, and overexpression of this gene may play a role in the metastasis of multiple types of cancer by increasing cell motility. Expression of this gene is also a marker for Reed-Sternberg cells in Hodgkin's lymphoma. A pseudogene of this gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 15.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the fibroblast growth factor receptor family, where amino acid sequence is highly conserved between members and throughout evolution. FGFR family members differ from one another in their ligand affinities and tissue distribution. A full-length representative protein consists of an extracellular region, composed of three immunoglobulin-like domains, a single hydrophobic membrane-spanning segment and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. The extracellular portion of the protein interacts with fibroblast growth factors, setting in motion a cascade of downstream signals, ultimately influencing mitogenesis and differentiation. This particular family member is a high-affinity receptor for acidic, basic and/or keratinocyte growth factor, depending on the isoform.

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) family, with its amino acid sequence being highly conserved between members and among divergent species. FGFR family members differ from one another in their ligand affinities and tissue distribution. A full-length representative protein would consist of an extracellular region, composed of three immunoglobulin-like domains, a single hydrophobic membrane-spanning segment and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. The extracellular portion of the protein interacts with fibroblast growth factors, setting in motion a cascade of downstream signals, ultimately influencing mitogenesis and differentiation. This particular family member binds acidic and basic fibroblast growth hormone and plays a role in bone development and maintenance. Mutations in this gene lead to craniosynostosis and multiple types of skeletal dysplasia.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) family, where amino acid sequence is highly conserved between members and throughout evolution. FGFR family members differ from one another in their ligand affinities and tissue distribution. A full-length representative protein consists of an extracellular region, composed of three immunoglobulin-like domains, a single hydrophobic membrane-spanning segment and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. The extracellular portion of the protein interacts with fibroblast growth factors, setting in motion a cascade of downstream signals, ultimately influencing mitogenesis and differentiation. This particular family member binds both acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors and is involved in limb induction. Mutations in this gene have been associated with Pfeiffer syndrome, Jackson-Weiss syndrome, Antley-Bixler syndrome, osteoglophonic dysplasia, and autosomal dominant Kallmann syndrome 2. Chromosomal aberrations involving this gene are associated with stem cell myeloproliferative disorder and stem cell leukemia lymphoma syndrome. Alternatively spliced variants which encode different protein isoforms have been described; however, not all variants have been fully characterized.","Variant counts

This gene is a member of the formin homology protein family. The encoded protein is thought to have essential roles in organization of the actin cytoskeleton and in cell polarity. This protein mediates the formation of an actin mesh that positions the spindle during oogenesis and also regulates the formation of actin filaments in the nucleus. This protein also forms a perinuclear actin/focal-adhesion system that regulates the shape and position of the nucleus during cell migration. Mutations in this gene have been associated with infertility and also with an autosomal recessive form of intellectual disability (MRT47). Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been identified.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a secreted, extracellular matrix protein containing an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif and calcium-binding EGF-like domains. It promotes adhesion of endothelial cells through interaction of integrins and the RGD motif. It is prominently expressed in developing arteries but less so in adult vessels. However, its expression is reinduced in balloon-injured vessels and atherosclerotic lesions, notably in intimal vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells. Therefore, the protein encoded by this gene may play a role in vascular development and remodeling. Defects in this gene are a cause of autosomal dominant cutis laxa, autosomal recessive cutis laxa type I (CL type I), and age-related macular degeneration type 3 (ARMD3).","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a nuclear phosphoprotein of unknown function. This gene contains a tandem CGG repeat region within a CpG island that normally consists of 8-14 repeats but can expand to over 200 repeats. The repeat region is within the 5' UTR of some transcript variants, but is intronic to another variant. The expanded repeat allele is a fragile site and becomes hypermethylated, causing a reduction in gene expression. A disease phenotype has not been associated with expanded alleles. This gene is found within the rare FRA10A folate-sensitive fragile site.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the F-box protein family which is characterized by an approximately 40 amino acid motif, the F-box. The F-box proteins constitute one of the four subunits of the ubiquitin protein ligase complex called SCFs (SKP1-cullin-F-box), which function in phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination. The F-box proteins are divided into 3 classes: Fbws containing WD-40 domains, Fbls containing leucine-rich repeats, and Fbxs containing either different protein-protein interaction modules or no recognizable motifs. The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the Fbxs class. This protein is highly similar to the rat NFB42 (neural F Box 42 kDa) protein which is enriched in the nervous system and may play a role in maintaining neurons in a postmitotic state.","Variant counts

Summary
The intracellular fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) belongs to a multigene family. FABPs are divided into at least three distinct types, namely the hepatic-, intestinal- and cardiac-type. They form 14-15 kDa proteins and are thought to participate in the uptake, intracellular metabolism and/or transport of long-chain fatty acids. They may also be responsible in the modulation of cell growth and proliferation. Fatty acid-binding protein 3 gene contains four exons and its function is to arrest growth of mammary epithelial cells. This gene is a candidate tumor suppressor gene for human breast cancer. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The Fanconi anemia complementation group (FANC) currently includes FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1 (also called BRCA2), FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCI, FANCJ (also called BRIP1), FANCL, FANCM and FANCN (also called PALB2). The previously defined group FANCH is the same as FANCA. Fanconi anemia is a genetically heterogeneous recessive disorder characterized by cytogenetic instability, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, increased chromosomal breakage, and defective DNA repair. The members of the Fanconi anemia complementation group do not share sequence similarity; they are related by their assembly into a common nuclear protein complex. This gene encodes the protein for complementation group D2. This protein is monoubiquinated in response to DNA damage, resulting in its localization to nuclear foci with other proteins (BRCA1 AND BRCA2) involved in homology-directed DNA repair. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the production of geranyl pyrophosphate and farnesyl pyrophosphate from isopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate. The resulting product, farnesyl pyrophosphate, is a key intermediate in cholesterol and sterol biosynthesis, a substrate for protein farnesylation and geranylgeranylation, and a ligand or agonist for certain hormone receptors and growth receptors. Drugs that inhibit this enzyme prevent the post-translational modifications of small GTPases and have been used to treat diseases related to bone resorption. Multiple pseudogenes have been found on chromosomes 1, 7, 14, 15, 21 and X. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the folate receptor (FOLR) family, and these genes exist in a cluster on chromosome 11. Members of this gene family have a high affinity for folic acid and for several reduced folic acid derivatives, and they mediate delivery of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate to the interior of cells. This protein has a 68% and 79% sequence homology with the FOLR1 and FOLR3 proteins, respectively. Although this protein was originally thought to be specific to placenta, it can also exist in other tissues, and it may play a role in the transport of methotrexate in synovial macrophages in rheumatoid arthritis patients. Multiple transcript variants that encode the same protein have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a putative transmembrane protein that is localized to the cis-Golgi compartment, where it may be involved in the glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan in skeletal muscle. The encoded protein is thought to be a glycosyltransferase and could play a role in brain development. Defects in this gene are a cause of Fukuyama-type congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD), Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS), limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2M (LGMD2M), and dilated cardiomyopathy type 1X (CMD1X). Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a subunit of the CPSF (cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor) complex that polyadenylates the 3' end of mRNA precursors. This gene, the homolog of yeast Fip1 (factor interacting with PAP), binds to U-rich sequences of pre-mRNA and stimulates poly(A) polymerase activity. Its N-terminus contains a PAP-binding site and its C-terminus an RNA-binding domain. An interstitial chromosomal deletion on 4q12 creates an in-frame fusion of human genes FIP1L1 and PDGFRA (platelet-derived growth factor receptor, alpha). The FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene encodes a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase that joins the first 233 amino acids of FIP1L1 to the last 523 amino acids of PDGFRA. This gene fusion and chromosomal deletion is the cause of some forms of idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES). This syndrome, recently reclassified as chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL), is responsive to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and cell shape. This protein contains an actin filament-binding domain, which together with its Dbl homology domain and one of its pleckstrin homology domains, can form microspikes. This protein can activate MAPK8 independently of the actin filament-binding domain, and it is also involved in the activation of CDC42 via the exchange of bound GDP for free GTP. The activation of CDC42 also enables this protein to play a role in mediating the cellular invasion of Cryptosporidium parvum, an intracellular parasite that infects the gastrointestinal tract. Mutations in this gene can cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4H (CMT4H), a disorder of the peripheral nervous system. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that contains Dbl (DH) and pleckstrin (PH) homology domains and is similar to the Rho family of small GTP-binding proteins. The encoded protein specifically binds to the Rho family GTPase Cdc42Hs and can stimulate the GDP-GTP exchange of the isoprenylated form of Cdc42Hs. It also stimulates the mitogen activated protein kinase cascade leading to c-Jun kinase SAPK/JNK1 activation. Defects in this gene are the cause of the faciogenital dysplasia in Aarskog-Scott syndrome and a syndromatic form of X-linked cognitive disability.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the folate receptor family. Members of this gene family bind folic acid and its reduced derivatives, and transport 5-methyltetrahydrofolate into cells. This gene product is a secreted protein that either anchors to membranes via a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol linkage or exists in a soluble form. Mutations in this gene have been associated with neurodegeneration due to cerebral folate transport deficiency. Due to the presence of two promoters, multiple transcription start sites, and alternative splicing, multiple transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene is a single pass membrane protein primarily found in ovaries. A similar protein in erythrocytes helps determine the shape of red blood cells, but the function of the encoded protein has not been determined. There is some evidence that this is a tumor suppressor gene, and there is also evidence linking defects in this gene to susceptibility to diabetic nephropathy in type 1 diabetes. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene is an intermediate filament-associated protein that aggregates keratin intermediate filaments in mammalian epidermis. It is initially synthesized as a polyprotein precursor, profilaggrin (consisting of multiple filaggrin units of 324 aa each), which is localized in keratohyalin granules, and is subsequently proteolytically processed into individual functional filaggrin molecules. Mutations in this gene are associated with ichthyosis vulgaris.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family. FGF family members bind heparin and possess broad mitogenic and angiogenic activities. This protein has been implicated in diverse biological processes, such as limb and nervous system development, wound healing, and tumor growth. The mRNA for this gene contains multiple polyadenylation sites, and is alternatively translated from non-AUG (CUG) and AUG initiation codons, resulting in five different isoforms with distinct properties. The CUG-initiated isoforms are localized in the nucleus and are responsible for the intracrine effect, whereas, the AUG-initiated form is mostly cytosolic and is responsible for the paracrine and autocrine effects of this FGF.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) family, where amino acid sequence is highly conserved between members and throughout evolution. FGFR family members differ from one another in their ligand affinities and tissue distribution. A full-length representative protein would consist of an extracellular region, composed of three immunoglobulin-like domains, a single hydrophobic membrane-spanning segment and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. The extracellular portion of the protein interacts with fibroblast growth factors, setting in motion a cascade of downstream signals, ultimately influencing mitogenesis and differentiation. A marked difference between this gene product and the other family members is its lack of a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. The result is a transmembrane receptor that could interact with other family members and potentially inhibit signaling. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same isoform have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
L-fucose is a key sugar in glycoproteins and other complex carbohydrates since it may be involved in many of the functional roles of these macromolecules, such as in cell-cell recognition. The fucosyl donor for these fucosylated oligosaccharides is GDP-beta-L-fucose. There are two alternate pathways for the biosynthesis of GDP-fucose; the major pathway converts GDP-alpha-D-mannose to GDP-beta-L-fucose. The protein encoded by this gene participates in an alternate pathway that is present in certain mammalian tissues, such as liver and kidney, and appears to function as a salvage pathway to reutilize L-fucose arising from the turnover of glycoproteins and glycolipids. This pathway involves the phosphorylation of L-fucose to form beta-L-fucose-1-phosphate, and then condensation of the beta-L-fucose-1-phosphate with GTP by fucose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase to form GDP-beta-L-fucose. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Read-through transcription also exists between this gene and the neighboring downstream TNNI3 interacting kinase (TNNI3K) gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes the folylpolyglutamate synthetase enzyme. This enzyme has a central role in establishing and maintaining both cytosolic and mitochondrial folylpolyglutamate concentrations and, therefore, is essential for folate homeostasis and the survival of proliferating cells.

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is required for the reduction of fatty acids to fatty alcohols, a process that is required for the synthesis of monoesters and ether lipids. NADPH is required as a cofactor in this reaction, and 16-18 carbon saturated and unsaturated fatty acids are the preferred substrate. This is a peroxisomal membrane protein, and studies suggest that the N-terminus contains a large catalytic domain located on the outside of the peroxisome, while the C-terminus is exposed to the matrix of the peroxisome. Studies indicate that the regulation of this protein is dependent on plasmalogen levels. Mutations in this gene have been associated with individuals affected by severe intellectual disability, early-onset epilepsy, microcephaly, congenital cataracts, growth retardation, and spasticity (PMID: 25439727). A pseudogene of this gene is located on chromosome 13.","Variant counts

Summary
Tight junctions represent one mode of cell-to-cell adhesion in epithelial or endothelial cell sheets, forming continuous seals around cells and serving as a physical barrier to prevent solutes and water from passing freely through the paracellular space. The protein encoded by this immunoglobulin superfamily gene member is an important regulator of tight junction assembly in epithelia. In addition, the encoded protein can act as (1) a receptor for reovirus, (2) a ligand for the integrin LFA1, involved in leukocyte transmigration, and (3) a platelet receptor. Multiple 5' alternatively spliced variants, encoding the same protein, have been identified but their biological validity has not been established.","Variant counts

Members of the F-box protein family, such as FBXW10, are characterized by an approximately 40-amino acid F-box motif. SCF complexes, formed by SKP1 (MIM 601434), cullin (see CUL1; MIM 603134), and F-box proteins, act as protein-ubiquitin ligases. F-box proteins interact with SKP1 through the F box, and they interact with ubiquitination targets through other protein interaction domains (Jin et al., 2004 [PubMed 15520277]).","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the F-box protein family which is characterized by an approximately 40 amino acid motif, the F-box. The F-box proteins constitute one of the four subunits of ubiquitin protein ligase complex called SCFs (SKP1-cullin-F-box), which function in phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination. The F-box proteins are divided into 3 classes: Fbws containing WD-40 domains, Fbls containing leucine-rich repeats, and Fbxs containing either different protein-protein interaction modules or no recognizable motifs. The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the Fbws class and, in addition to an F-box, contains multiple WD40 repeats. This gene contains at least 14 exons, and its alternative splicing generates 3 transcript variants diverging at the presence/absence of two alternate exons.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the TNF-receptor superfamily. This receptor contains a death domain. It has been shown to play a central role in the physiological regulation of programmed cell death, and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various malignancies and diseases of the immune system. The interaction of this receptor with its ligand allows the formation of a death-inducing signaling complex that includes Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD), caspase 8, and caspase 10. The autoproteolytic processing of the caspases in the complex triggers a downstream caspase cascade, and leads to apoptosis. This receptor has been also shown to activate NF-kappaB, MAPK3/ERK1, and MAPK8/JNK, and is found to be involved in transducing the proliferating signals in normal diploid fibroblast and T cells. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described, some of which are candidates for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). The isoforms lacking the transmembrane domain may negatively regulate the apoptosis mediated by the full length isoform.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is the cellular homolog of the fox sequence in the Finkel-Biskis-Reilly murine sarcoma virus (FBR-MuSV). It encodes a fusion protein consisting of the ubiquitin-like protein fubi at the N terminus and ribosomal protein S30 at the C terminus. It has been proposed that the fusion protein is post-translationally processed to generate free fubi and free ribosomal protein S30. Fubi is a member of the ubiquitin family, and ribosomal protein S30 belongs to the S30E family of ribosomal proteins. Whereas the function of fubi is currently unknown, ribosomal protein S30 is a component of the 40S subunit of the cytoplasmic ribosome and displays antimicrobial activity. Pseudogenes derived from this gene are present in the genome. Similar to ribosomal protein S30, ribosomal proteins S27a and L40 are synthesized as fusion proteins with ubiquitin.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the subtilisin-like proprotein convertase family, which includes proteases that process protein and peptide precursors trafficking through regulated or constitutive branches of the secretory pathway. It encodes a type 1 membrane bound protease that is expressed in many tissues, including neuroendocrine, liver, gut, and brain. The encoded protein undergoes an initial autocatalytic processing event in the ER and then sorts to the trans-Golgi network through endosomes where a second autocatalytic event takes place and the catalytic activity is acquired. Like other members of this convertase family, the product of this gene specifically cleaves substrates at single or paired basic residues. Some of its substrates include proparathyroid hormone, transforming growth factor beta 1 precursor, proalbumin, pro-beta-secretase, membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase, beta subunit of pro-nerve growth factor and von Willebrand factor. It is thought to be one of the proteases responsible for the activation of HIV envelope glycoproteins gp160 and gp140, and may play a role in tumor progression. Unlike SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses, the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be uniquely cleaved by this protease. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily. The primary function of the encoded transmembrane protein is the induction of apoptosis triggered by binding to FAS. The FAS/FASLG signaling pathway is essential for immune system regulation, including activation-induced cell death (AICD) of T cells and cytotoxic T lymphocyte induced cell death. It has also been implicated in the progression of several cancers. Defects in this gene may be related to some cases of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the forkhead/winged-helix (FOX) family of transcription factors with highly conserved FOX DNA-binding domains. Members of the FOX family of transcription factors are regulators of embryogenesis and may play a role in human cancer. This gene lies in a region of chromosome 2 that surrounds the site where two ancestral chromosomes fused to form human chromosome 2. This region is duplicated elsewhere in the human genome, primarily in subtelomeric and pericentromeric locations, thus mutiple copies of this gene have been found.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the F-box protein family which is characterized by an approximately 40 amino acid motif, the F-box. The F-box proteins constitute one of the four subunits of the ubiquitin protein ligase complex called SCFs (SKP1-cullin-F-box), which function in phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination. The F-box proteins are divided into 3 classes: Fbws containing WD-40 domains, Fbls containing leucine-rich repeats, and Fbxs containing either different protein-protein interaction modules or no recognizable motifs. The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the Fbxs class and, as a transcriptional target of the tumor protein p53, is thought to be involved in degradation of specific proteins in response to p53 induction. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is an enzymatic component of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, or Krebs cycle, and catalyzes the formation of L-malate from fumarate. It exists in both a cytosolic form and an N-terminal extended form, differing only in the translation start site used. The N-terminal extended form is targeted to the mitochondrion, where the removal of the extension generates the same form as in the cytoplasm. It is similar to some thermostable class II fumarases and functions as a homotetramer. Mutations in this gene can cause fumarase deficiency and lead to progressive encephalopathy.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes coagulation factor III which is a cell surface glycoprotein. This factor enables cells to initiate the blood coagulation cascades, and it functions as the high-affinity receptor for the coagulation factor VII. The resulting complex provides a catalytic event that is responsible for initiation of the coagulation protease cascades by specific limited proteolysis. Unlike the other cofactors of these protease cascades, which circulate as nonfunctional precursors, this factor is a potent initiator that is fully functional when expressed on cell surfaces, for example, on monocytes. There are 3 distinct domains of this factor: extracellular, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic. Platelets and monocytes have been shown to express this coagulation factor under procoagulatory and proinflammatory stimuli, and a major role in HIV-associated coagulopathy has been described. Platelet-dependent monocyte expression of coagulation factor III has been described to be associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity and mortality. This protein is the only one in the coagulation pathway for which a congenital deficiency has not been described. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes an essential cofactor of the blood coagulation cascade. This factor circulates in plasma, and is converted to the active form by the release of the activation peptide by thrombin during coagulation. This generates a heavy chain and a light chain which are held together by calcium ions. The activated protein is a cofactor that participates with activated coagulation factor X to activate prothrombin to thrombin. Defects in this gene result in either an autosomal recessive hemorrhagic diathesis or an autosomal dominant form of thrombophilia, which is known as activated protein C resistance.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes coagulation factor VII which is a vitamin K-dependent factor essential for hemostasis. This factor circulates in the blood in a zymogen form, and is converted to an active form by either factor IXa, factor Xa, factor XIIa, or thrombin by minor proteolysis. Upon activation of the factor VII, a heavy chain containing a catalytic domain and a light chain containing 2 EGF-like domains are generated, and two chains are held together by a disulfide bond. In the presence of factor III and calcium ions, the activated factor then further activates the coagulation cascade by converting factor IX to factor IXa and/or factor X to factor Xa. Defects in this gene can cause coagulopathy. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms that may undergo similar proteolytic processing to generate mature polypeptides.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes coagulation factor VIII, which participates in the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation; factor VIII is a cofactor for factor IXa which, in the presence of Ca+2 and phospholipids, converts factor X to the activated form Xa. This gene produces two alternatively spliced transcripts. Transcript variant 1 encodes a large glycoprotein, isoform a, which circulates in plasma and associates with von Willebrand factor in a noncovalent complex. This protein undergoes multiple cleavage events. Transcript variant 2 encodes a putative small protein, isoform b, which consists primarily of the phospholipid binding domain of factor VIIIc. This binding domain is essential for coagulant activity. Defects in this gene results in hemophilia A, a common recessive X-linked coagulation disorder.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor IX that circulates in the blood as an inactive zymogen. This factor is converted to an active form by factor XIa, which excises the activation peptide and thus generates a heavy chain and a light chain held together by one or more disulfide bonds. The role of this activated factor IX in the blood coagulation cascade is to activate factor X to its active form through interactions with Ca+2 ions, membrane phospholipids, and factor VIII. Alterations of this gene, including point mutations, insertions and deletions, cause factor IX deficiency, which is a recessive X-linked disorder, also called hemophilia B or Christmas disease. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms that may undergo similar proteolytic processing.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of a small family of Fas-activated serine/threonine kinase domain (FASTKD) containing proteins that share an amino terminal mitochondrial targeting domain and multiple carboxy terminal FAST domains as well as a putative RNA-binding RAP domain. The members of this family are ubiquitously expressed and are generally most abundant in mitochondria-enriched tissues such as heart, skeletal muscle and brown-adipose tissue. Some members of this protein family may play a role in apoptosis. The protein encoded by this gene interacts with components of the mitochondrial respiratory and translation networks. A pseudogene of this gene is also present on chromosome 5. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
Fibromodulin belongs to the family of small interstitial proteoglycans. The encoded protein possesses a central region containing leucine-rich repeats with 4 keratan sulfate chains, flanked by terminal domains containing disulphide bonds. Owing to the interaction with type I and type II collagen fibrils and in vitro inhibition of fibrillogenesis, the encoded protein may play a role in the assembly of extracellular matrix. It may also regulate TGF-beta activities by sequestering TGF-beta into the extracellular matrix. Sequence variations in this gene may be associated with the pathogenesis of high myopia. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a flavin-containing monooxygenase family member. It is an NADPH-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the N-oxidation of some primary alkylamines through an N-hydroxylamine intermediate. However, some human populations contain an allele (FMO2*2A) with a premature stop codon, resulting in a protein that is C-terminally-truncated, has no catalytic activity, and is likely degraded rapidly. This gene is found in a cluster with other related family members on chromosome 1. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
Flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMO) are an important class of drug-metabolizing enzymes that catalyze the NADPH-dependent oxygenation of various nitrogen-,sulfur-, and phosphorous-containing xenobiotics such as therapeutic drugs, dietary compounds, pesticides, and other foreign compounds. The human FMO gene family is composed of 5 genes and multiple pseudogenes. FMO members have distinct developmental- and tissue-specific expression patterns. The expression of this FMO3 gene, the major FMO expressed in adult liver, can vary up to 20-fold between individuals. This inter-individual variation in FMO3 expression levels is likely to have significant effects on the rate at which xenobiotics are metabolised and, therefore, is of considerable interest to the pharmaceutical industry. This transmembrane protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum of many tissues. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. Mutations in this gene cause the disorder trimethylaminuria (TMAu) which is characterized by the accumulation and excretion of unmetabolized trimethylamine and a distinctive body odor. In healthy individuals, trimethylamine is primarily converted to the non odorous trimethylamine N-oxide.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the immunophilin protein family, which play a role in immunoregulation and basic cellular processes involving protein folding and trafficking. This encoded protein is a cis-trans prolyl isomerase that binds to the immunosuppressants FK506 and rapamycin. It has high structural and functional similarity to FK506-binding protein 1A (FKBP1A), but unlike FKBP1A, this protein does not have immunosuppressant activity when complexed with FK506. It interacts with interferon regulatory factor-4 and plays an important role in immunoregulatory gene expression in B and T lymphocytes. This encoded protein is known to associate with phytanoyl-CoA alpha-hydroxylase. It can also associate with two heat shock proteins (hsp90 and hsp70) and thus may play a role in the intracellular trafficking of hetero-oligomeric forms of the steroid hormone receptors. This protein correlates strongly with adeno-associated virus type 2 vectors (AAV) resulting in a significant increase in AAV-mediated transgene expression in human cell lines. Thus this encoded protein is thought to have important implications for the optimal use of AAV vectors in human gene therapy. The human genome contains several non-transcribed pseudogenes similar to this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the immunophilin protein family, which play a role in immunoregulation and basic cellular processes involving protein folding and trafficking. This encoded protein is a cis-trans prolyl isomerase that binds to the immunosuppressants FK506 and rapamycin. It is thought to mediate calcineurin inhibition. It also interacts functionally with mature hetero-oligomeric progesterone receptor complexes along with the 90 kDa heat shock protein and P23 protein. This gene has been found to have multiple polyadenylation sites. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts
