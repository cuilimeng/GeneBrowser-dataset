Summary
LY6G6C belongs to a cluster of leukocyte antigen-6 (LY6) genes located in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class III region on chromosome 6. Members of the LY6 superfamily typically contain 70 to 80 amino acids, including 8 to 10 cysteines. Most LY6 proteins are attached to the cell surface by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor that is directly involved in signal transduction (Mallya et al., 2002 [PubMed 12079290]).","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a highly conserved protein consisting entirely of PLAT (polycystin/lipoxygenase/alpha-toxin) domains, thought to be involved in targeting proteins to the plasma membrane. Studies in mice show that this gene is expressed in the mechanosensory hair cells in the inner ear, and mutations in this gene lead to auditory defects, indicating that this gene is essential for normal hair cell function. Screening of human families segregating deafness identified a mutation in this gene which causes DFNB77, a progressive form of autosomal-recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL). Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been noted for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a zinc-dependent aminopeptidase that cleaves vasopressin, oxytocin, lys-bradykinin, met-enkephalin, dynorphin A and other peptide hormones. The protein can be secreted in maternal serum, reside in intracellular vesicles with the insulin-responsive glucose transporter GLUT4, or form a type II integral membrane glycoprotein. The protein catalyzes the final step in the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin IV (AT4) and is also a receptor for AT4. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
Laminins, a family of extracellular matrix glycoproteins, are the major noncollagenous constituent of basement membranes. They have been implicated in a wide variety of biological processes including cell adhesion, differentiation, migration, signaling, neurite outgrowth and metastasis. Laminins are composed of 3 non identical chains: laminin alpha, beta and gamma (formerly A, B1, and B2, respectively) and they form a cruciform structure consisting of 3 short arms, each formed by a different chain, and a long arm composed of all 3 chains. Each laminin chain is a multidomain protein encoded by a distinct gene. Several isoforms of each chain have been described. Different alpha, beta and gamma chain isomers combine to give rise to different heterotrimeric laminin isoforms which are designated by Arabic numerals in the order of their discovery, i.e. alpha1beta1gamma1 heterotrimer is laminin 1. The biological functions of the different chains and trimer molecules are largely unknown, but some of the chains have been shown to differ with respect to their tissue distribution, presumably reflecting diverse functions in vivo. This gene encodes the beta chain isoform laminin, beta 1. The beta 1 chain has 7 structurally distinct domains which it shares with other beta chain isomers. The C-terminal helical region containing domains I and II are separated by domain alpha, domains III and V contain several EGF-like repeats, and domains IV and VI have a globular conformation. Laminin, beta 1 is expressed in most tissues that produce basement membranes, and is one of the 3 chains constituting laminin 1, the first laminin isolated from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) tumor. A sequence in the beta 1 chain that is involved in cell attachment, chemotaxis, and binding to the laminin receptor was identified and shown to have the capacity to inhibit metastasis.","Variant counts

Laminins, a family of extracellular matrix glycoproteins, are the major noncollagenous constituent of basement membranes. They have been implicated in a wide variety of biological processes including cell adhesion, differentiation, migration, signaling, neurite outgrowth and metastasis. Laminins, composed of 3 non identical chains: laminin alpha, beta and gamma (formerly A, B1, and B2, respectively), form a cruciform structure consisting of 3 short arms, each formed by a different chain, and a long arm composed of all 3 chains.

The biological functions of the different chains and trimer molecules are largely unknown, but some of the chains have been shown to differ with respect to their tissue distribution, presumably reflecting diverse functions in vivo. This gene encodes the beta chain isoform laminin, beta 2. The beta 2 chain contains the 7 structural domains typical of beta chains of laminin, including the short alpha region. However, unlike beta 1 chain, beta 2 has a more restricted tissue distribution. It is enriched in the basement membrane of muscles at the neuromuscular junctions, kidney glomerulus and vascular smooth muscle. Transgenic mice in which the beta 2 chain gene was inactivated by homologous recombination, showed defects in the maturation of neuromuscular junctions and impairment of glomerular filtration. Alternative splicing involving a non consensus 5' splice site (gc) in the 5' UTR of this gene has been reported. It was suggested that inefficient splicing of this first intron, which does not change the protein sequence, results in a greater abundance of the unspliced form of the transcript than the spliced form. The full-length nature of the spliced transcript is not known.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a cysteine protease that has a strict specificity for hydrolysis of asparaginyl bonds. This enzyme may be involved in the processing of bacterial peptides and endogenous proteins for MHC class II presentation in the lysosomal/endosomal systems. Enzyme activation is triggered by acidic pH and appears to be autocatalytic. Protein expression occurs after monocytes differentiate into dendritic cells. A fully mature, active enzyme is produced following lipopolysaccharide expression in mature dendritic cells. Overexpression of this gene may be associated with the majority of solid tumor types. This gene has a pseudogene on chromosome 13. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described, but the biological validity of only two has been determined. These two variants encode the same isoform.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the LSm family of RNA-binding proteins. LSm proteins form stable heteromers that bind specifically to the 3'-terminal oligo(U) tract of U6 snRNA and may play a role in pre-mRNA splicing by mediating U4/U6 snRNP formation. Increased expression of this gene may play a role in cellular transformation and the progression of several malignancies including lung cancer, mesothelioma and breast cancer. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been observed for this gene, and a pseudogene of this gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 9.","Variant counts

Summary
Sm-like proteins were identified in a variety of organisms based on sequence homology with the Sm protein family (see SNRPD2; MIM 601061). Sm-like proteins contain the Sm sequence motif, which consists of 2 regions separated by a linker of variable length that folds as a loop. The Sm-like proteins are thought to form a stable heteromer present in tri-snRNP particles, which are important for pre-mRNA splicing.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene, low density lipoprotein-related protein 2 (LRP2) or megalin, is a multi-ligand endocytic receptor that is expressed in many different tissues but primarily in absorptive epithilial tissues such as the kidney. This glycoprotein has a large amino-terminal extracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a short carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic tail. The extracellular ligand-binding-domains bind diverse macromolecules including albumin, apolipoproteins B and E, and lipoprotein lipase. The LRP2 protein is critical for the reuptake of numerous ligands, including lipoproteins, sterols, vitamin-binding proteins, and hormones. This protein also has a role in cell-signaling; extracellular ligands include parathyroid horomones and the morphogen sonic hedgehog while cytosolic ligands include MAP kinase scaffold proteins and JNK interacting proteins. Recycling of this membrane receptor is regulated by phosphorylation of its cytoplasmic domain. Mutations in this gene cause Donnai-Barrow syndrome (DBS) and facio-oculoacoustico-renal syndrome (FOAR).","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family of proteins. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed by furin to generate 515 kDa and 85 kDa subunits that form the mature receptor (PMID: 8546712). This receptor is involved in several cellular processes, including intracellular signaling, lipid homeostasis, and clearance of apoptotic cells. In addition, the encoded protein is necessary for the alpha 2-macroglobulin-mediated clearance of secreted amyloid precursor protein and beta-amyloid, the main component of amyloid plaques found in Alzheimer patients. Expression of this gene decreases with age and has been found to be lower than controls in brain tissue from Alzheimer's disease patients.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene family. LDL receptors are transmembrane cell surface proteins involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis of lipoprotein and protein ligands. The protein encoded by this gene functions as a receptor or, with Frizzled, a co-receptor for Wnt and thereby transmits the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling cascade. Through its interaction with the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling cascade this gene plays a role in the regulation of cell differentiation, proliferation, and migration and the development of many cancer types. This protein undergoes gamma-secretase dependent RIP- (regulated intramembrane proteolysis) processing but the precise locations of the cleavage sites have not been determined.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a transmembrane low-density lipoprotein receptor that binds and internalizes ligands in the process of receptor-mediated endocytosis. This protein also acts as a co-receptor with Frizzled protein family members for transducing signals by Wnt proteins and was originally cloned on the basis of its association with type 1 diabetes mellitus in humans. This protein plays a key role in skeletal homeostasis and many bone density related diseases are caused by mutations in this gene. Mutations in this gene also cause familial exudative vitreoretinopathy. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family. Low density lipoprotein receptors are cell surface proteins that play roles in both signal transduction and receptor-mediated endocytosis of specific ligands for lysosomal degradation. The encoded protein plays a critical role in the migration of neurons during development by mediating Reelin signaling, and also functions as a receptor for the cholesterol transport protein apolipoprotein E. Expression of this gene may be a marker for major depressive disorder. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the leiomodin family of proteins. This protein contains three actin-binding domains, a tropomyosin domain, a leucine-rich repeat domain, and a Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein homology 2 domain (WH2). Localization of this protein to the pointed ends of thin filaments has been observed, and there is evidence that this protein acts as a catalyst of actin nucleation, and is important to the organization of sarcomeric thin filaments in skeletal muscles. Mutations in this gene have been associated as one cause of Nemaline myopathy, as other genes have also been linked to this disorder. Nemaline myopathy is a disorder characterized by nonprogressive generalized muscle weakness and protein inclusions (nemaline bodies) in skeletal myofibers. Patients with mutations in this gene often present with a severe congenital form of the disorder.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is an inhibitory receptor found on peripheral mononuclear cells, including natural killer cells, T cells, and B cells. Inhibitory receptors regulate the immune response to prevent lysis of cells recognized as self. The gene is a member of both the immunoglobulin superfamily and the leukocyte-associated inhibitory receptor family. The gene maps to a region of 19q13.4 called the leukocyte receptor cluster, which contains at least 29 genes encoding leukocyte-expressed receptors of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The encoded protein has been identified as an anchor for tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1, and may induce cell death in myeloid leukemias. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the lipocalin family of small secretory proteins. Lipocalins are extracellular transport proteins that bind to a variety of hydrophobic ligands. The encoded protein is the primary lipid binding protein in tears and is overproduced in response to multiple stimuli including infection and stress. The encoded protein may be a marker for chromosome aneuploidy as well as an autoantigen in Sjogren's syndrome. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene, and two pseudogenes of this gene are also located on the long arm of chromosome 9.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that belongs to the lipocalin family. Members of this family transport small hydrophobic molecules such as lipids, steroid hormones and retinoids. The protein encoded by this gene is a neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and plays a role in innate immunity by limiting bacterial growth as a result of sequestering iron-containing siderophores. The presence of this protein in blood and urine is an early biomarker of acute kidney injury. This protein is thought to be be involved in multiple cellular processes, including maintenance of skin homeostasis, and suppression of invasiveness and metastasis. Mice lacking this gene are more susceptible to bacterial infection than wild type mice.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the Src family of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs). The encoded protein is a key signaling molecule in the selection and maturation of developing T-cells. It contains N-terminal sites for myristylation and palmitylation, a PTK domain, and SH2 and SH3 domains which are involved in mediating protein-protein interactions with phosphotyrosine-containing and proline-rich motifs, respectively. The protein localizes to the plasma membrane and pericentrosomal vesicles, and binds to cell surface receptors, including CD4 and CD8, and other signaling molecules. Multiple alternatively spliced variants encoding different isoforms have been described.","Variant counts

Summary
The low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene family consists of cell surface proteins involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis of specific ligands. Low density lipoprotein (LDL) is normally bound at the cell membrane and taken into the cell ending up in lysosomes where the protein is degraded and the cholesterol is made available for repression of microsomal enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis. At the same time, a reciprocal stimulation of cholesterol ester synthesis takes place. Mutations in this gene cause the autosomal dominant disorder, familial hypercholesterolemia. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The lethal (2) giant larvae protein of Drosophila plays a role in asymmetric cell division, epithelial cell polarity, and cell migration. This human gene encodes a protein similar to lethal (2) giant larvae of Drosophila. In fly, the protein's ability to localize cell fate determinants is regulated by the atypical protein kinase C (aPKC). In human, this protein interacts with aPKC-containing complexes and is cortically localized in mitotic cells. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
The nuclear lamina consists of a two-dimensional matrix of proteins located next to the inner nuclear membrane. The lamin family of proteins make up the matrix and are highly conserved in evolution. During mitosis, the lamina matrix is reversibly disassembled as the lamin proteins are phosphorylated. Lamin proteins are thought to be involved in nuclear stability, chromatin structure and gene expression. Vertebrate lamins consist of two types, A and B. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Mutations in this gene lead to several diseases: Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, familial partial lipodystrophy, limb girdle muscular dystrophy, dilated cardiomyopathy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome.","Variant counts

Summary
The galectins are a family of beta-galactoside-binding proteins implicated in modulating cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. LGALS3BP has been found elevated in the serum of patients with cancer and in those infected by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It appears to be implicated in immune response associated with natural killer (NK) and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell cytotoxicity. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization the full length 90K cDNA has been localized to chromosome 17q25. The native protein binds specifically to a human macrophage-associated lectin known as Mac-2 and also binds galectin 1.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene belongs to the ESO/LAGE gene family, members of which are clustered together on chromosome Xq28, and have similar exon-intron structures. Unlike the other family members which are normally expressed only in testis and activated in a wide range of human tumors, this gene is ubiquitously expressed in somatic tissues. The latter, combined with the finding that it is highly conserved in mouse and rat, suggests that the encoded protein is functionally important. An intronless pseudogene with high sequence similarity to this gene is located on chromosome 9.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes alpha-lactalbumin, a principal protein of milk. Alpha-lactalbumin forms the regulatory subunit of the lactose synthase (LS) heterodimer and beta 1,4-galactosyltransferase (beta4Gal-T1) forms the catalytic component. Together, these proteins enable LS to produce lactose by transfering galactose moieties to glucose. As a monomer, alpha-lactalbumin strongly binds calcium and zinc ions and may possess bactericidal or antitumor activity. A folding variant of alpha-lactalbumin, called HAMLET, likely induces apoptosis in tumor and immature cells.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the protein kinase superfamily and the protein tyrosine kinase family. It contains N-terminal transmembrane helices and a long C-terminal cytoplasmic tail with serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase activity. This protein interacts with several other proteins, such as Inhibitor-2 (Inh2), protein phosphatase-1 (PP1C), p35, and myosin VI. It phosporylates other proteins, and is itself also phosporylated when interacting with cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5)/p35 complex. This protein involves in nerve growth factor (NGF)-TrkA signalling, and also plays a critical role in endosomal membrane trafficking. Mouse studies suggested an essential role of this protein in spermatogenesis.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a LIN-28 family RNA-binding protein that acts as a posttranscriptional regulator of genes involved in developmental timing and self-renewal in embryonic stem cells. The encoded protein functions through direct interaction with target mRNAs and by disrupting the maturation of certain miRNAs involved in embryonic development. This protein prevents the terminal processing of the LET7 family of microRNAs which are major regulators of cellular growth and differentiation. Aberrant expression of this gene is associated with cancer progression in multiple tissues.","Variant counts

Similar to other members of this focal-adhesion-associated adaptor-protein family, it has four leucine-rich LD-motifs in the N-terminus and four LIM domains in the C-terminus. It may function in cell type-specific signaling by associating with PYK2, a member of focal adhesion kinase family. As a substrate for a tyrosine kinase in lymphoid cells, this protein may also function in, and be regulated by, tyrosine kinase activity. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.","Variant counts

The ubiquitin-like protein FAT10 prevents the interaction of the encoded protein and TLR4, thereby inactivating the nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathway. In addition, this protein can downregulate the NLRP3 inflammasome by recruiting the caspase-1 inhibitor Flightless-I to the inflammasome complex.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is an adaptor protein which contains five LIM domains, or double zinc fingers. The protein is likely involved in integrin signaling through its LIM domain-mediated interaction with integrin-linked kinase, found in focal adhesion plaques. It is also thought to act as a bridge linking integrin-linked kinase to NCK adaptor protein 2, which is involved in growth factor receptor kinase signaling pathways. Its localization to the periphery of spreading cells also suggests that this protein may play a role in integrin-mediated cell adhesion or spreading. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Plastins are a family of actin-binding proteins that are conserved throughout eukaryote evolution and expressed in most tissues of higher eukaryotes. In humans, two ubiquitous plastin isoforms (L and T) have been identified. Plastin 1 (otherwise known as Fimbrin) is a third distinct plastin isoform which is specifically expressed at high levels in the small intestine. The L isoform is expressed only in hemopoietic cell lineages, while the T isoform has been found in all other normal cells of solid tissues that have replicative potential (fibroblasts, endothelial cells, epithelial cells, melanocytes, etc.). However, L-plastin has been found in many types of malignant human cells of non-hemopoietic origin suggesting that its expression is induced accompanying tumorigenesis in solid tissues.","Variant counts

Summary
There are approximately 40 known eukaryotic LIM proteins, so named for the LIM domains they contain. LIM domains are highly conserved cysteine-rich structures containing 2 zinc fingers. Although zinc fingers usually function by binding to DNA or RNA, the LIM motif probably mediates protein-protein interactions. LIM kinase-1 and LIM kinase-2 belong to a small subfamily with a unique combination of 2 N-terminal LIM motifs and a C-terminal protein kinase domain. The protein encoded by this gene is phosphorylated and activated by ROCK, a downstream effector of Rho, and the encoded protein, in turn, phosphorylates cofilin, inhibiting its actin-depolymerizing activity. It is thought that this pathway contributes to Rho-induced reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. At least three transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

LIM kinase-1 and LIM kinase-2 belong to a small subfamily with a unique combination of 2 N-terminal LIM motifs and a C-terminal protein kinase domain. LIMK1 is a serine/threonine kinase that regulates actin polymerization via phosphorylation and inactivation of the actin binding factor cofilin. This protein is ubiquitously expressed during development and plays a role in many cellular processes associated with cytoskeletal structure. This protein also stimulates axon growth and may play a role in brain development. LIMK1 hemizygosity is implicated in the impaired visuospatial constructive cognition of Williams syndrome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
In human, peroxisomes function primarily to catalyze fatty acid beta-oxidation and, as a by-product, produce hydrogen peroxide and superoxide. The protein encoded by this gene is an ATP-dependent protease that likely plays a role in maintaining overall peroxisome homeostasis as well as proteolytically degrading peroxisomal proteins damaged by oxidation. The protein has an N-terminal Lon N substrate recognition domain, an ATPase domain, a proteolytic domain, and, in some isoforms, a C-terminal peroxisome targeting sequence. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a mitochondrial matrix protein that belongs to the Lon family of ATP-dependent proteases. This protein mediates the selective degradation of misfolded, unassembled or oxidatively damaged polypeptides in the mitochondrial matrix. It may also have a chaperone function in the assembly of inner membrane protein complexes, and participate in the regulation of mitochondrial gene expression and maintenance of the integrity of the mitochondrial genome. Decreased expression of this gene has been noted in a patient with hereditary spastic paraplegia (PMID:18378094). Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the glycoprotein hormone beta chain family and encodes the beta subunit of luteinizing hormone (LH). Glycoprotein hormones are heterodimers consisting of a common alpha subunit and an unique beta subunit which confers biological specificity. LH is expressed in the pituitary gland and promotes spermatogenesis and ovulation by stimulating the testes and ovaries to synthesize steroids. The genes for the beta chains of chorionic gonadotropin and for luteinizing hormone are contiguous on chromosome 19q13.3. Mutations in this gene are associated with hypogonadism which is characterized by infertility and pseudohermaphroditism.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a protein containing domains found in the La related protein of Drosophila melanogaster. La motif-containing proteins are thought to be RNA-binding proteins, where the La motif and adjacent amino acids fold into an RNA recognition motif. The La motif is also found in proteins unrelated to the La protein. Alternative splicing has been observed at this locus and multiple variants, encoding distinct isoforms, are described. Additional splice variation has been identified but the full-length nature of these transcripts has not been determined.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene is a serine proteinase that inhibits the activity of tissue-type plasminogen activator I. The encoded protein constitutes a substantial portion of lipoprotein(a) and is proteolytically cleaved, resulting in fragments that attach to atherosclerotic lesions and promote thrombogenesis. Elevated plasma levels of this protein are linked to atherosclerosis. Depending on the individual, the encoded protein contains 2-43 copies of kringle-type domains. The allele represented here contains 15 copies of the kringle-type repeats and corresponds to that found in the reference genome sequence.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the lysyl oxidase family of proteins. The prototypic member of the family is essential to the biogenesis of connective tissue, encoding an extracellular copper-dependent amine oxidase that catalyzes the first step in the formation of crosslinks in collagen and elastin. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate the mature enzyme. A highly conserved amino acid sequence at the C-terminus end appears to be sufficient for amine oxidase activity, suggesting that each family member may retain this function. The N-terminus is poorly conserved and may impart additional roles in developmental regulation, senescence, tumor suppression, cell growth control, and chemotaxis to each member of the family. Mutations in this gene are associated with exfoliation syndrome.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the galectin family of carbohydrate binding proteins. Members of this protein family have an affinity for beta-galactosides. The encoded protein is characterized by an N-terminal proline-rich tandem repeat domain and a single C-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain. This protein can self-associate through the N-terminal domain allowing it to bind to multivalent saccharide ligands. This protein localizes to the extracellular matrix, the cytoplasm and the nucleus. This protein plays a role in numerous cellular functions including apoptosis, innate immunity, cell adhesion and T-cell regulation. The protein exhibits antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a putative serine/threonine kinase that localizes to the mitotic apparatus and complexes with cell cycle controller CDC2 kinase in early mitosis. The protein is phosphorylated in a cell-cycle dependent manner, with late prophase phosphorylation remaining through metaphase. The N-terminal region of the protein binds CDC2 to form a complex showing reduced H1 histone kinase activity, indicating a role as a negative regulator of CDC2/cyclin A. In addition, the C-terminal kinase domain binds to its own N-terminal region, suggesting potential negative regulation through interference with complex formation via intramolecular binding. Biochemical and genetic data suggest a role as a tumor suppressor. This is supported by studies in knockout mice showing development of soft-tissue sarcomas, ovarian stromal cell tumors and a high sensitivity to carcinogenic treatments.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a secreted ligand of the TGF-beta (transforming growth factor-beta) superfamily of proteins. Ligands of this family bind various TGF-beta receptors leading to recruitment and activation of SMAD family transcription factors that regulate gene expression. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate the mature protein, which plays a role in left-right asymmetry determination of organ systems during development. The protein may also play a role in endometrial bleeding. Mutations in this gene have been associated with left-right axis malformations, particularly in the heart and lungs. Some types of infertility have been associated with dysregulated expression of this gene in the endometrium. This gene is closely linked to both a related family member and a related pseudogene. This gene encodes multiple isoforms that may undergo similar proteolytic processing.","Variant counts

The process of transferring lipoic acid to proteins is a two-step process. The first step is the activation of lipoic acid by lipoate-activating enzyme to form lipoyl-AMP. For the second step, the protein encoded by this gene transfers the lipoyl moiety to apoproteins. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. A related pseudogene has been identified on chromosome 13. Read-through transcription also exists between this gene and the neighboring downstream mitochondrial ribosomal protein L30 (MRPL30) gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the glycosyltransferase 31 gene family. Members of this gene family, which also includes the MFNG (GeneID: 4242) and RFNG (GeneID: 5986) genes, encode evolutionarily conserved glycosyltransferases that act in the Notch signaling pathway to define boundaries during embryonic development. While their genomic structure is distinct from other glycosyltransferases, these proteins have a fucose-specific beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity that leads to elongation of O-linked fucose residues on Notch, which alters Notch signaling. The protein encoded by this gene is predicted to be a single-pass type II Golgi membrane protein but it may also be secreted and proteolytically processed like the related proteins in mouse and Drosophila (PMID: 9187150). Mutations in this gene have been associated with autosomal recessive spondylocostal dysostosis 3.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the LMBR1-like membrane protein family. Another member of this protein family has been shown to be a lipocalin transmembrane receptor. A highly conserved, cis-acting regulatory module for the sonic hedgehog gene is located within an intron of this gene. Consequently, disruption of this genic region can alter sonic hedgehog expression and affect limb patterning, but it is not known if this gene functions directly in limb development. Mutations and chromosomal deletions and rearrangements in this genic region are associated with acheiropody and preaxial polydactyly, which likely result from altered sonic hedgehog expression.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a GPI-anchored, cell membrane bound member of the Ly6/uPAR (LU) superfamily of proteins containing the unique three-finger LU domain. This protein interacts with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), and is thought to function as a modulator of nAChR activity to prevent excessive excitation. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. Read-through transcription between this gene and the neighboring downstream gene (SLURP2) generates naturally-occurring transcripts (LYNX1-SLURP2) that encode a fusion protein comprised of sequence sharing identity with each individual gene product.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a ubiquitously expressed protein that localizes to the cytoplasm. This protein interacts with Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS) proteins and, through its interaction with BBS protein complexes, regulates protein trafficking to the ciliary membrane. Nonsense mutations in this gene cause a form of Bardet-Biedl Syndrome; a ciliopathy characterized in part by polydactyly, obesity, cognitive impairment, hypogonadism, and kidney failure. This gene may also function as a tumor suppressor; possibly by interacting with E-cadherin and the actin cytoskeleton and thereby regulating the transition of epithelial cells to mesenchymal cells.","Variant counts

Summary
Lipopolysaccharide is a potent stimulator of monocytes and macrophages, causing secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and other inflammatory mediators. This gene encodes lipopolysaccharide-induced TNF-alpha factor, which is a DNA-binding protein and can mediate the TNF-alpha expression by direct binding to the promoter region of the TNF-alpha gene. The transcription of this gene is induced by tumor suppressor p53 and has been implicated in the p53-induced apoptotic pathway. Mutations in this gene cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1C (CMT1C) and may be involved in the carcinogenesis of extramammary Paget's disease (EMPD). Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is involved in the acute-phase immunologic response to gram-negative bacterial infections. Gram-negative bacteria contain a glycolipid, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), on their outer cell wall. Together with bactericidal permeability-increasing protein (BPI), the encoded protein binds LPS and interacts with the CD14 receptor, probably playing a role in regulating LPS-dependent monocyte responses. Studies in mice suggest that the encoded protein is necessary for the rapid acute-phase response to LPS but not for the clearance of LPS from circulation. This protein is part of a family of structurally and functionally related proteins, including BPI, plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), and phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP).","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is an axonal glycoprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin supergene family. The ectodomain, consisting of several immunoglobulin-like domains and fibronectin-like repeats (type III), is linked via a single transmembrane sequence to a conserved cytoplasmic domain. This cell adhesion molecule plays an important role in nervous system development, including neuronal migration and differentiation. Mutations in the gene cause X-linked neurological syndromes known as CRASH (corpus callosum hypoplasia, retardation, aphasia, spastic paraplegia and hydrocephalus). Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants, some of which include an alternate exon that is considered to be specific to neurons.","Variant counts

LMO2 encodes a cysteine-rich, two LIM-domain protein that is required for yolk sac erythropoiesis. The LMO2 protein has a central and crucial role in hematopoietic development and is highly conserved. The LMO2 transcription start site is located approximately 25 kb downstream from the 11p13 T-cell translocation cluster (11p13 ttc), where a number T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia-specific translocations occur. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
Laminins, a family of extracellular matrix glycoproteins, are the major noncollagenous constituent of basement membranes. They have been implicated in a wide variety of biological processes including cell adhesion, differentiation, migration, signaling, neurite outgrowth and metastasis. Laminins are composed of 3 non identical chains: laminin alpha, beta and gamma (formerly A, B1, and B2, respectively) and they form a cruciform structure consisting of 3 short arms, each formed by a different chain, and a long arm composed of all 3 chains. Each laminin chain is a multidomain protein encoded by a distinct gene. Several isoforms of each chain have been described. Different alpha, beta and gamma chain isomers combine to give rise to different heterotrimeric laminin isoforms which are designated by Arabic numerals in the order of their discovery, i.e. alpha1beta1gamma1 heterotrimer is laminin 1. The biological functions of the different chains and trimer molecules are largely unknown, but some of the chains have been shown to differ with respect to their tissue distribution, presumably reflecting diverse functions in vivo. This gene encodes the gamma chain isoform laminin, gamma 3. The gamma 3 chain is most similar to the gamma 1 chain, and contains all the 6 domains expected of the gamma chain. It is a component of laminin 12. The gamma 3 chain is broadly expressed in skin, heart, lung, and the reproductive tracts. In skin, it is seen within the basement membrane of the dermal-epidermal junction at points of nerve penetration. Gamma 3 is also a prominent element of the apical surface of ciliated epithelial cells of lung, oviduct, epididymis, ductus deferens, and seminiferous tubules. The distribution of gamma 3-containing laminins along ciliated epithelial surfaces suggests that the apical laminins are important in the morphogenesis and structural stability of the ciliated processes of these cells.","Variant counts

This gene encodes the gamma chain isoform laminin, gamma 1. The gamma 1 chain, formerly thought to be a beta chain, contains structural domains similar to beta chains, however, lacks the short alpha region separating domains I and II. The structural organization of this gene also suggested that it had diverged considerably from the beta chain genes. Embryos of transgenic mice in which both alleles of the gamma 1 chain gene were inactivated by homologous recombination, lacked basement membranes, indicating that laminin, gamma 1 chain is necessary for laminin heterotrimer assembly. It has been inferred by analogy with the strikingly similar 3' UTR sequence in mouse laminin gamma 1 cDNA, that multiple polyadenylation sites are utilized in human to generate the 2 different sized mRNAs (5.5 and 7.5 kb) seen on Northern analysis.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein belonging to the L-type lectin group of type 1 membrane proteins, which function in the mammalian early secretory pathway. These proteins contain luminal carbohydrate recognition domains, which display homology to leguminous lectins. Unlike other proteins of the group, which cycle in the early secretory pathway and are predominantly associated with post endoplasmic reticulum membranes, the protein encoded by this gene is a non-cycling resident protein of the ER, where it functions as a cargo receptor for glycoproteins. It is proposed to regulate exchange of folded proteins for transport to the Golgi and exchange of misfolded glycoproteins for transport to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene has evolved in primates as a fusion of two ancestral neighboring genes, Lrrc51 and Tomt, which exist as two independent genes in rodents. The fusion gene contains some shared exons, but encodes structurally unrelated proteins, LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. Those variants that utilize the more centromere-proximal 3' terminal exon (short transcript form) encode LRTOMT1, while those variants that use a more centromere-distal 3' terminal exon (long transcript form) encode the LRTOMT2 protein. There is a small region within one of the exons of this gene that contains overlapping alternate reading frames for both LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. LRTOMT1 shares similarity with the protein encoded by mouse Lrrc51, while LRTOMT2 shares similarity with the protein encoded by mouse Tomt. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, encoding different isoforms of both LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. The LRTOMT1 protein is a leucine-rich repeat-containing protein, while the LRTOMT2 protein is a catechol-O-methyltransferase that catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to a hydroxyl group of catechols and is essential for auditory and vestibular function. Mutations in this gene have been associated with nonsyndromic deafness.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a membrane-bound protein that is involved in signal transduction and protein interactions. The encoded product is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, which mediates ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of proteins containing phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains. This protein may play an important role in tumorogenesis. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been described. A pseudogene, which is located on chromosome 17, has been identified for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes an oxidoreductase that promotes fatty-acid oxidation, with concomitant inflammasome activation, mitochondrial and NADPH-oxidase-dependent reactive oxygen species production, and bactericidal activity of macrophages. The encoded protein forms a complex with fatty acid synthase on peroxisomes and is thought to be modulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor signaling events. Naturally occurring mutations in this gene are associated with inflammatory bowel disease, Behcet's disease, leprosy, ulcerative colitis, early-onset Crohn's disease, and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a leucine-rich protein that has multiple pentatricopeptide repeats (PPR). The precise role of this protein is unknown but studies suggest it may play a role in cytoskeletal organization, vesicular transport, or in transcriptional regulation of both nuclear and mitochondrial genes. The protein localizes primarily to mitochondria and is predicted to have an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence. Mutations in this gene are associated with the French-Canadian type of Leigh syndrome.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor (LIR) family. LIR family members are known to have activating and inibitory functions in leukocytes. Crosslink of this receptor protein on the surface of monocytes has been shown to induce calcium flux and secretion of several proinflammatory cytokines, which suggests the roles of this protein in triggering innate immune responses. This gene is one of the leukocyte receptor genes that form a gene cluster on the chromosomal region 19q13.4. Four alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been described.","Variant counts

This gene encodes the B subunit of lactate dehydrogenase enzyme, which catalyzes the interconversion of pyruvate and lactate with concomitant interconversion of NADH and NAD+ in a post-glycolysis process. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. Recent studies have shown that a C-terminally extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform is localized in the peroxisomes. Mutations in this gene are associated with lactate dehydrogenase B deficiency. Pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes X, 5 and 13.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes the receptor for both luteinizing hormone and choriogonadotropin. This receptor belongs to the G-protein coupled receptor 1 family, and its activity is mediated by G proteins which activate adenylate cyclase. Mutations in this gene result in disorders of male secondary sexual character development, including familial male precocious puberty, also known as testotoxicosis, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, Leydig cell adenoma with precocious puberty, and male pseudohermaphtoditism with Leydig cell hypoplasia.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the mitochondrial leucine/tyrosine/arginine motif family of proteins. Proteins of this family are short polypeptides that contain a leucine/tyrosine/arginine motif near the N-terminus. This gene is widely expressed with high levels in omental adipose tissue of obese individuals. In adipose tissue, the protein is localized to the nucleus where it promotes preadipocyte proliferation and lowers the rate of apoptosis to regulate adipose tissue homeostasis. Overexpression of this gene in adipocytes causes abnormal mitochondrial morphology and mitochondrial dysfunction. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the lysyl oxidase family of proteins. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, at least one of which encodes a preproprotein that is proteolytically processed to generate a regulatory propeptide and the mature enzyme. The copper-dependent amine oxidase activity of this enzyme functions in the crosslinking of collagens and elastin, while the propeptide may play a role in tumor suppression. In addition, defects in this gene have been linked with predisposition to thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.","Variant counts

Summary
Sm-like proteins were identified in a variety of organisms based on sequence homology with the Sm protein family (see SNRPD2; 601061). Sm-like proteins contain the Sm sequence motif, which consists of 2 regions separated by a linker of variable length that folds as a loop. The Sm-like proteins are thought to form a stable heteromer present in tri-snRNP particles, which are important for pre-mRNA splicing.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the family of latent transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta binding proteins (LTBP), which are extracellular matrix proteins with multi-domain structure. This protein is the largest member of the LTBP family possessing unique regions and with most similarity to the fibrillins. It has thus been suggested that it may have multiple functions: as a member of the TGF-beta latent complex, as a structural component of microfibrils, and a role in cell adhesion.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the family of latent TGF-beta binding proteins (LTBPs). The secretion and activation of TGF-betas is regulated by their association with latency-associated proteins and with latent TGF-beta binding proteins. The product of this gene targets latent complexes of transforming growth factor beta to the extracellular matrix, where the latent cytokine is subsequently activated by several different mechanisms. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene interacts with components of the origin recognition complex (ORC) and regulates the formation of the prereplicative complex. The encoded protein stabilizes the ORC and therefore aids in DNA replication. This protein is required for the G1/S phase transition of the cell cycle. In addition, the encoded protein binds to trimethylated histone H3 in heterochromatin and recruits the ORC and lysine methyltransferases, which help maintain the repressive heterochromatic state. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of family 1 glycosidases. Glycosidases are enzymes that hydrolyze glycosidic bonds and are classified into families based on primary amino acid sequence. Most members of family 1 have two conserved glutamic acid residues, which are required for enzymatic activity. The mouse ortholog of this protein has been characterized and has a domain structure of an N-terminal signal peptide, glycosidase domain, transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail. It lacks one of the conserved glutamic acid residues important for catalysis, and its function remains to be determined (PMID: 12084582). Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a transcription factor belonging to a family of proteins that share homology with the high mobility group protein-1. The protein encoded by this gene can bind to a functionally important site in the T-cell receptor-alpha enhancer, thereby conferring maximal enhancer activity. This transcription factor is involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, and it may function in hair cell differentiation and follicle morphogenesis. Mutations in this gene have been found in somatic sebaceous tumors. This gene has also been linked to other cancers, including androgen-independent prostate cancer. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a DNA ligase that joins single-strand breaks in a double-stranded polydeoxynucleotide in an ATP-dependent reaction. This protein is essential for V(D)J recombination and DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair through nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). This protein forms a complex with the X-ray repair cross complementing protein 4 (XRCC4), and further interacts with the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). Both XRCC4 and DNA-PK are known to be required for NHEJ. The crystal structure of the complex formed by this protein and XRCC4 has been resolved. Defects in this gene are the cause of LIG4 syndrome. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein have been observed.","Variant counts

This gene is a member of the DNA ligase family. Each member of this family encodes a protein that catalyzes the joining of DNA ends but they each have a distinct role in DNA metabolism. The protein encoded by this gene is involved in excision repair and is located in both the mitochondria and nucleus, with translation initiation from the upstream start codon allowing for transport to the mitochondria and translation initiation from a downstream start codon allowing for transport to the nucleus. Additionally, alternate transcriptional splice variants, encoding different isoforms, have been characterized.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the leucine zipper tumor suppressor family of proteins, which function in transcription regulation and cell cycle control. This family member can repress beta-catenin-mediated transcriptional activation and is a negative regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway. It negatively regulates microtubule severing at centrosomes, and is necessary for central spindle formation and cytokinesis completion. It is implicated in cancer, where it may inhibit cell proliferation and decrease susceptibility to tumor development. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a tumor suppressor protein that is ubiquitously expressed in normal tissues. In uveal melanomas, expression of this protein is silenced in rapidly metastasizing and metastatic tumor cells but has normal expression in slowly metastasizing or nonmetastasizing tumor cells. This protein may have a role in cell-cycle control by interacting with the Cdk1/cyclinB1 complex. This gene is located on chromosomal region 8p22. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the 8p arm is a common characteristic of many types of cancer.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene contains a leucine-rich repeat (LRR). It specifically interacts with TNFRSF9/4-1BB, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily. Overexpression of this gene suppresses the activation of NF-kappa B induced by TNFRSF9 or TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), which suggests that this protein is a negative regulator of TNFRSF9-mediated signaling cascades. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase gene family. It encodes a glycosyltransferase which participates in glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan, and may carry out the synthesis of glycoprotein and glycosphingolipid sugar chains. It may also be involved in the addition of a repeated disaccharide unit. The protein encoded by this gene is the glycotransferase that adds the final xylose and glucuronic acid to alpha-dystroglycan and thereby allows alpha-dystroglycan to bind ligands including laminin 211 and neurexin. Mutations in this gene cause several forms of congenital muscular dystrophy characterized by cognitive disability and abnormal glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants that encode the same protein.","Variant counts

Summary
This locus encodes a transcriptional regulator that contains two cysteine-rich LIM domains but lacks a DNA-binding domain. LIM domains may play a role in protein interactions; thus the encoded protein may regulate transcription by competitively binding to specific DNA-binding transcription factors. Alterations at this locus have been associated with acute lymphoblastic T-cell leukemia. Chromosomal rearrangements have been observed between this locus and at least two loci, the delta subunit of the T-cell antigen receptor gene and the LIM domain binding 1 gene. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the lin-28 family, which is characterized by the presence of a cold-shock domain and a pair of CCHC zinc finger domains. This gene is highly expressed in testis, fetal liver, placenta, and in primary human tumors and cancer cell lines. It is negatively regulated by microRNAs that target sites in the 3' UTR, and overexpression of this gene in primary tumors is linked to the repression of let-7 family of microRNAs and derepression of let-7 targets, which facilitates cellular transformation.","Variant counts

Summary
Lymphotoxin beta is a type II membrane protein of the TNF family. It anchors lymphotoxin-alpha to the cell surface through heterotrimer formation. The predominant form on the lymphocyte surface is the lymphotoxin-alpha 1/beta 2 complex (e.g. 1 molecule alpha/2 molecules beta) and this complex is the primary ligand for the lymphotoxin-beta receptor. The minor complex is lymphotoxin-alpha 2/beta 1. LTB is an inducer of the inflammatory response system and involved in normal development of lymphoid tissue. Lymphotoxin-beta isoform b is unable to complex with lymphotoxin-alpha suggesting a function for lymphotoxin-beta which is independent of lympyhotoxin-alpha. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
The product of this gene is highly conserved with a mouse protein associated with the cytoplasmic face of late endosomes and lysosomes. The mouse protein interacts with MAPK scaffold protein 1, a component of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. In humans, a mutation in this gene has been associated with a primary immunodeficiency syndrome, and suggests a role for this protein in endosomal biogenesis. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a scaffold protein that functions in the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade. The protein is localized to late endosomes by the mitogen-activated protein-binding protein-interacting protein, and binds specifically to MAP kinase kinase MAP2K1/MEK1, MAP kinase MAPK3/ERK1, and MAP kinase MAPK1/ERK2. Studies of the orthologous gene in mouse indicate that it regulates late endosomal traffic and cell proliferation. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene. A pseudogene of this gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 13.","Variant counts

Summary
Laminin, an extracellular protein, is a major component of the basement membrane. It is thought to mediate the attachment, migration, and organization of cells into tissues during embryonic development by interacting with other extracellular matrix components. It is composed of three subunits, alpha, beta, and gamma, which are bound to each other by disulfide bonds into a cross-shaped molecule. This gene encodes the alpha 2 chain, which constitutes one of the subunits of laminin 2 (merosin) and laminin 4 (s-merosin). Mutations in this gene have been identified as the cause of congenital merosin-deficient muscular dystrophy. Two transcript variants encoding different proteins have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the laminin family of secreted molecules. Laminins are heterotrimeric molecules that consist of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits that assemble through a coiled-coil domain. Laminins are essential for formation and function of the basement membrane and have additional functions in regulating cell migration and mechanical signal transduction. This gene encodes an alpha subunit and is responsive to several epithelial-mesenchymal regulators including keratinocyte growth factor, epidermal growth factor and insulin-like growth factor. Mutations in this gene have been identified as the cause of Herlitz type junctional epidermolysis bullosa and laryngoonychocutaneous syndrome. Alternative splicing and alternative promoter usage result in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
Laminins, a family of extracellular matrix glycoproteins, are the major noncollagenous constituent of basement membranes. They have been implicated in a wide variety of biological processes including cell adhesion, differentiation, migration, signaling, neurite outgrowth and metastasis. Laminins are composed of 3 non identical chains: laminin alpha, beta and gamma (formerly A, B1, and B2, respectively) and they form a cruciform structure consisting of 3 short arms, each formed by a different chain, and a long arm composed of all 3 chains. Each laminin chain is a multidomain protein encoded by a distinct gene. Several isoforms of each chain have been described. Different alpha, beta and gamma chain isomers combine to give rise to different heterotrimeric laminin isoforms which are designated by Arabic numerals in the order of their discovery, i.e. alpha1beta1gamma1 heterotrimer is laminin 1. The biological functions of the different chains and trimer molecules are largely unknown, but some of the chains have been shown to differ with respect to their tissue distribution, presumably reflecting diverse functions in vivo. This gene encodes the alpha chain isoform laminin, alpha 4. The domain structure of alpha 4 is similar to that of alpha 3, both of which resemble truncated versions of alpha 1 and alpha 2, in that approximately 1,200 residues at the N-terminus (domains IV, V and VI) have been lost. Laminin, alpha 4 contains the C-terminal G domain which distinguishes all alpha chains from the beta and gamma chains. The RNA analysis from adult and fetal tissues revealed developmental regulation of expression, however, the exact function of laminin, alpha 4 is not known. Tissue-specific utilization of alternative polyA-signal has been described in literature. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that belongs to the type I cytokine receptor family. This protein combines with a high-affinity converter subunit, gp130, to form a receptor complex that mediates the action of the leukemia inhibitory factor, a polyfunctional cytokine that is involved in cellular differentiation, proliferation and survival in the adult and the embryo. Mutations in this gene cause Schwartz-Jampel syndrome type 2, a disease belonging to the group of the bent-bone dysplasias. A translocation that involves the promoter of this gene, t(5;8)(p13;q12) with the pleiomorphic adenoma gene 1, is associated with salivary gland pleiomorphic adenoma, a common type of benign epithelial tumor of the salivary gland. Multiple splice variants encoding two different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the lipin family of proteins, and all family members share strong homology in their C-terminal region. This protein is thought to form hetero-oligomers with other lipin family members, while one family member, lipin 1, can also form homo-oligomers. This protein contains conserved motifs for phosphatidate phosphatase 1 (PAP1) activity as well as a domain that interacts with a transcriptional co-activator. Lipin complexes act in the cytoplasm to catalyze the dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid to produce diacylglycerol, which is the precursor of both triglycerides and phospholipids. Lipin complexes are also thought to regulate gene expression as transcriptional co-activators in the nucleus. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a magnesium-ion-dependent phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase enzyme that catalyzes the penultimate step in triglyceride synthesis including the dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid to yield diacylglycerol. Expression of this gene is required for adipocyte differentiation and it also functions as a nuclear transcriptional coactivator with some peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors to modulate expression of other genes involved in lipid metabolism. Mutations in this gene are associated with metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, acute recurrent rhabdomyolysis, and autosomal recessive acute recurrent myoglobinuria (ARARM). This gene is also a candidate for several human lipodystrophy syndromes.","Variant counts

Sm-like proteins were identified in a variety of organisms based on sequence homology with the Sm protein family (see SNRPD2; MIM 601061). Sm-like proteins contain the Sm sequence motif, which consists of 2 regions separated by a linker of variable length that folds as a loop. The Sm-like proteins are thought to form a stable heteromer present in tri-snRNP particles, which are important for pre-mRNA splicing.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a PDZ domain-containing protein. PDZ motifs are modular protein-protein interaction domains consisting of 80-120 amino acid residues. PDZ domain-containing proteins interact with each other in cytoskeletal assembly or with other proteins involved in targeting and clustering of membrane proteins. The protein encoded by this gene interacts with alpha-actinin-2 through its N-terminal PDZ domain and with protein kinase C via its C-terminal LIM domains. The LIM domain is a cysteine-rich motif defined by 50-60 amino acids containing two zinc-binding modules. This protein also interacts with all three members of the myozenin family. Mutations in this gene have been associated with myofibrillar myopathy and dilated cardiomyopathy. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified; all isoforms have N-terminal PDZ domains while only longer isoforms (1, 2 and 5) have C-terminal LIM domains.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is phosphorylated by ZAP-70/Syk protein tyrosine kinases following activation of the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) signal transduction pathway. This transmembrane protein localizes to lipid rafts and acts as a docking site for SH2 domain-containing proteins. Upon phosphorylation, this protein recruits multiple adaptor proteins and downstream signaling molecules into multimolecular signaling complexes located near the site of TCR engagement. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
Laminins, a family of extracellular matrix glycoproteins, are the major noncollagenous constituent of basement membranes. They have been implicated in a wide variety of biological processes including cell adhesion, differentiation, migration, signaling, neurite outgrowth and metastasis. Laminins, composed of 3 non identical chains: laminin alpha, beta and gamma (formerly A, B1, and B2, respectively), have a cruciform structure consisting of 3 short arms, each formed by a different chain, and a long arm composed of all 3 chains. Each laminin chain is a multidomain protein encoded by a distinct gene. Several isoforms of each chain have been described. Different alpha, beta and gamma chain isomers combine to give rise to different heterotrimeric laminin isoforms which are designated by Arabic numerals in the order of their discovery, i.e. alpha1beta1gamma1 heterotrimer is laminin 1. The biological functions of the different chains and trimer molecules are largely unknown, but some of the chains have been shown to differ with respect to their tissue distribution, presumably reflecting diverse functions in vivo. This gene encodes the gamma chain isoform laminin, gamma 2. The gamma 2 chain, formerly thought to be a truncated version of beta chain (B2t), is highly homologous to the gamma 1 chain; however, it lacks domain VI, and domains V, IV and III are shorter. It is expressed in several fetal tissues but differently from gamma 1, and is specifically localized to epithelial cells in skin, lung and kidney. The gamma 2 chain together with alpha 3 and beta 3 chains constitute laminin 5 (earlier known as kalinin), which is an integral part of the anchoring filaments that connect epithelial cells to the underlying basement membrane. The epithelium-specific expression of the gamma 2 chain implied its role as an epithelium attachment molecule, and mutations in this gene have been associated with junctional epidermolysis bullosa, a skin disease characterized by blisters due to disruption of the epidermal-dermal junction. Two transcript variants resulting from alternative splicing of the 3' terminal exon, and encoding different isoforms of gamma 2 chain, have been described. The two variants are differentially expressed in embryonic tissues, however, the biological significance of the two forms is not known. Transcript variants utilizing alternative polyA_signal have also been noted in literature.","Variant counts
