Summary
This gene encodes a ubiquitously expressed magnesium cation transporter protein that localizes to the cell membrane. This protein also associates with N-oligosaccharyl transferase and therefore may have a role in N-glycosylation. Mutations in this gene cause a form of X-linked intellectual disability (XLID). This gene may have multiple in-frame translation initiation sites, one of which would encode a shorter protein with an N-terminus containing a signal peptide at amino acids 1-29.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the SLC25 family of nuclear-encoded transporters that are localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Members of this superfamily are involved in many metabolic pathways and cell functions. Genome-wide association studies in human have identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms in several loci associated with obesity. This gene is one such locus, which is highly expressed in white adipose tissue and adipocytes, and thought to play a regulatory role in adipocyte differentiation and biology. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. A recent study showed this gene to be an authentic stop codon readthrough target that can produce two isoforms from the same mRNA by use of alternative in-frame translation termination codons.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the osteocalcin/matrix Gla family of proteins. The encoded vitamin K-dependent protein is secreted by chondrocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells, and functions as a physiological inhibitor of ectopic tissue calcification. Carboxylation status of the encoded protein is associated with calcification of the vasculature in human patients with cardiovascular disease and calcification of the synovial membranes in osteoarthritis patients. Mutations in this gene cause Keutel syndrome in human patients, which is characterized by abnormal cartilage calcification, peripheral pulmonary stenosis and facial hypoplasia.","Variant counts

Summary
The myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen (MNDA) is detected only in nuclei of cells of the granulocyte-monocyte lineage. A 200-amino acid region of human MNDA is strikingly similar to a region in the proteins encoded by a family of interferon-inducible mouse genes, designated Ifi-201, Ifi-202, and Ifi-203, that are not regulated in a cell- or tissue-specific fashion. The 1.8-kb MNDA mRNA, which contains an interferon-stimulated response element in the 5-prime untranslated region, was significantly upregulated in human monocytes exposed to interferon alpha. MNDA is located within 2,200 kb of FCER1A, APCS, CRP, and SPTA1. In its pattern of expression and/or regulation, MNDA resembles IFI16, suggesting that these genes participate in blood cell-specific responses to interferons.","Variant counts

Summary
The myosin II molecule is a multi-subunit complex consisting of two heavy chains and four light chains. This gene encodes a heavy chain of myosin II, which is a member of the motor-domain superfamily. The heavy chain includes a globular motor domain, which catalyzes ATP hydrolysis and interacts with actin, and a tail domain in which heptad repeat sequences promote dimerization by interacting to form a rod-like alpha-helical coiled coil. This heavy chain subunit is a slow-twitch myosin. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found, but the full-length nature of these variants is not determined.","Variant counts

Summary
Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are encoded by nuclear genes and help in protein synthesis within the mitochondrion. Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) consist of a small 28S subunit and a large 39S subunit. They have an estimated 75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes, where this ratio is reversed. Another difference between mammalian mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain a 5S rRNA. Among different species, the proteins comprising the mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence homology. This gene encodes a 28S subunit protein that belongs to the ribosomal protein S17P family. The encoded protein is moderately conserved between human mitochondrial and prokaryotic ribosomal proteins. Pseudogenes corresponding to this gene are found on chromosomes 1p, 3p, 6q, 14p, 18q, and Xq.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is highly similar to the metaxin 2 protein from mouse, which has been shown to interact with the mitochondrial membrane protein metaxin 1. Because of this similarity, it is thought that the encoded protein is peripherally associated with the cytosolic face of the outer mitochondrial membrane, and that it is involved in the import of proteins into the mitochondrion. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. A related pseudogene has been identified on chromosome 7.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes an unconventional myosin. This protein differs from other myosins in that it has a long N-terminal extension preceding the conserved motor domain. Studies in mice suggest that this protein is necessary for actin organization in the hair cells of the cochlea. Mutations in this gene have been associated with profound, congenital, neurosensory, nonsyndromal deafness. This gene is located within the Smith-Magenis syndrome region on chromosome 17. Read-through transcripts containing an upstream gene and this gene have been identified, but they are not thought to encode a fusion protein. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described, but their full length sequences have not been determined.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the Mastermind-like family of proteins. All family members are proline and glutamine-rich, and contain a conserved basic domain that binds the ankyrin repeat domain of the intracellular domain of the Notch receptors (ICN1-4) in their N-terminus, and a transcriptional activation domain in their C-terminus. This protein binds to an extended groove that is formed by the interaction of CBF1, Suppressor of Hairless, LAG-1 (CSL) with ICN, and positively regulates Notch signaling. High levels of expression of this gene have been observed in several B cell-derived lymphomas. Translocations resulting in fusion proteins with both CRTC1 and CRTC3 have been implicated in the development of mucoepidermoid carcinomas, while a translocation event with CXCR4 has been linked with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Copy number variation in the polyglutamine tract has been observed.","Variant counts

Summary
This protein is the human homolog of mastermind, a Drosophila protein that plays a role in the Notch signaling pathway involved in cell-fate determination. There is in vitro evidence that the human homolog forms a complex with the intracellular portion of human Notch receptors and can increase expression of a Notch-induced gene. This evidence supports its proposed function as a transcriptional co-activator in the Notch signaling pathway.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CAMK) Ser/Thr protein kinase family, which belongs to the protein kinase superfamily. This protein contains conserved DLG (asp-leu-gly) and ENIL (glu-asn-ile-leu) motifs, and an N-terminal polybasic region which binds importin A and the translation factor scaffold protein eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G). This protein is one of the downstream kinases activated by mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. It phosphorylates the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), thus playing important roles in the initiation of mRNA translation, oncogenic transformation and malignant cell proliferation. In addition to eIF4E, this protein also interacts with von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL), ring-box 1 (Rbx1) and Cullin2 (Cul2), which are all components of the CBC(VHL) ubiquitin ligase E3 complex. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found, but the full-length nature and biological activity of only two variants are determined. These two variants encode distinct isoforms which differ in activity and regulation, and in subcellular localization.","Variant counts

Summary
The transcript produced from this gene is bi-cistronic and can encode both myotrophin and leucine zipper protein 6. The myotrophin protein is associated with cardiac hypertrophy, where it is involved in the conversion of NFkappa B p50-p65 heterodimers to p50-p50 and p65-p65 homodimers. This protein also has a potential function in cerebellar morphogenesis, and it may be involved in the differentiation of cerebellar neurons, particularly of granule cells. A cryptic ORF at the 3' end of this transcript uses a novel internal ribosome entry site and a non-AUG translation initiation codon to produce leucine zipper protein 6, a 6.4 kDa tumor antigen that is associated with myeloproliferative disease.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes the class A macrophage scavenger receptors, which include three different types (1, 2, 3) generated by alternative splicing of this gene. These receptors or isoforms are macrophage-specific trimeric integral membrane glycoproteins and have been implicated in many macrophage-associated physiological and pathological processes including atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and host defense. The isoforms type 1 and type 2 are functional receptors and are able to mediate the endocytosis of modified low density lipoproteins (LDLs). The isoform type 3 does not internalize modified LDL (acetyl-LDL) despite having the domain shown to mediate this function in the types 1 and 2 isoforms. It has an altered intracellular processing and is trapped within the endoplasmic reticulum, making it unable to perform endocytosis. The isoform type 3 can inhibit the function of isoforms type 1 and type 2 when co-expressed, indicating a dominant negative effect and suggesting a mechanism for regulation of scavenger receptor activity in macrophages.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the Ser/Thr protein kinase family. This kinase functions as a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase)- activated protein kinase. MAP kinases are also known as extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), act as an integration point for multiple biochemical signals. This kinase was shown to be activated by growth inducers and stress stimulation of cells. In vitro studies demonstrated that ERK, p38 MAP kinase and Jun N-terminal kinase were all able to phosphorylate and activate this kinase, which suggested the role of this kinase as an integrative element of signaling in both mitogen and stress responses. This kinase was reported to interact with, phosphorylate and repress the activity of E47, which is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor known to be involved in the regulation of tissue-specific gene expression and cell differentiation. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants that encode the same protein.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the Ser/Thr protein kinase family. This kinase is regulated through direct phosphorylation by p38 MAP kinase. In conjunction with p38 MAP kinase, this kinase is known to be involved in many cellular processes including stress and inflammatory responses, nuclear export, gene expression regulation and cell proliferation. Heat shock protein HSP27 was shown to be one of the substrates of this kinase in vivo. Two transcript variants encoding two different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The major constituents of mucus, the viscous secretion that covers epithelial surfaces such as those in the trachea, colon, and cervix, are highly glycosylated proteins called mucins. These glycoproteins play important roles in the protection of the epithelial cells and have been implicated in epithelial renewal and differentiation. This gene encodes an integral membrane glycoprotein found on the cell surface, although secreted isoforms may exist. At least two dozen transcript variants of this gene have been found, although for many of them the full-length transcript has not been determined or they are found only in tumor tissues. This gene contains a region in the coding sequence which has a variable number (>100) of 48 nt tandem repeats.","Variant counts

Summary
Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are encoded by nuclear genes and help in protein synthesis within the mitochondrion. Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) consist of a small 28S subunit and a large 39S subunit. They have an estimated 75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes, where this ratio is reversed. Another difference between mammalian mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain a 5S rRNA. Among different species, the proteins comprising the mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence homology. This gene encodes a 39S subunit protein. Sequence analysis identified three transcript variants that encode two different isoforms. A pseudogene corresponding to this gene is found on chromosome 5q.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a member of the MAP kinase family. MAP kinases, also known as extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), act as an integration point for multiple biochemical signals, and are involved in a wide variety of cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, transcription regulation and development. The activation of this kinase requires its phosphorylation by upstream kinases. Upon activation, this kinase translocates to the nucleus of the stimulated cells, where it phosphorylates nuclear targets. One study also suggests that this protein acts as a transcriptional repressor independent of its kinase activity. The encoded protein has been identified as a moonlighting protein based on its ability to perform mechanistically distinct functions. Two alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein, but differing in the UTRs, have been reported for this gene.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the MAP kinase family. MAP kinases act as an integration point for multiple biochemical signals, and are involved in a wide variety of cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, transcription regulation and development. This kinase is activated by various cell stimuli, and targets specific transcription factors, and thus mediates immediate-early gene expression in response to cell stimuli. The activation of this kinase by tumor-necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) is found to be required for TNF-alpha induced apoptosis. This kinase is also involved in UV radiation induced apoptosis, which is thought to be related to cytochrom c-mediated cell death pathway. Studies of the mouse counterpart of this gene suggested that this kinase play a key role in T cell proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been reported.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that is a member of the mucin family. Mucins are high molecular weight, O-glycosylated proteins that play an important role in forming a protective mucous barrier, and are found on the apical surfaces of the epithelia. The encoded protein is a membrane-tethered mucin that contains an extracellular domain at its amino terminus, a large tandem repeat domain, and a transmembrane domain with a short cytoplasmic domain. The amino terminus is highly glycosylated, while the repeat region contains 156 amino acid repeats unit that are rich in serines, threonines, and prolines. Interspersed within the repeats are Sea urchin sperm protein Enterokinase and Agrin (SEA) modules, leucine-rich repeats and ankyrin (ANK) repeats. These regions together form the ectodomain, and there is a potential cleavage site found near an SEA module close to the transmembrane domain. This protein is thought to play a role in forming a barrier, protecting epithelial cells from pathogens. Products of this gene have been used as a marker for different cancers, with higher expression levels associated with poorer outcomes.","Variant counts

Summary
Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are encoded by nuclear genes and help in protein synthesis within the mitochondrion. Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) consist of a small 28S subunit and a large 39S subunit. They have an estimated 75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes, where this ratio is reversed. Another difference between mammalian mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain a 5S rRNA. Among different species, the proteins comprising the mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence homology. This gene encodes a 28S subunit protein that belongs to the ribosomal protein S16P family. The encoded protein is one of the most highly conserved ribosomal proteins between mammalian and yeast mitochondria. Three pseudogenes (located at 8q21.3, 20q13.32, 22q12-q13.1) for this gene have been described.","Variant counts

The encoded protein is a key component of the ribosomal small subunit and controls the decoding fidelity and susceptibility to aminoglycoside antibiotics. The gene for mitochondrial seryl-tRNA synthetase is located upstream and adjacent to this gene, and both genes are possible candidates for the autosomal dominant deafness gene (DFNA4). Splice variants that differ in the 5' UTR have been found for this gene; all three variants encode the same protein.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by the classic MBP gene is a major constituent of the myelin sheath of oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells in the nervous system. However, MBP-related transcripts are also present in the bone marrow and the immune system. These mRNAs arise from the long MBP gene (otherwise called 'Golli-MBP') that contains 3 additional exons located upstream of the classic MBP exons. Alternative splicing from the Golli and the MBP transcription start sites gives rise to 2 sets of MBP-related transcripts and gene products. The Golli mRNAs contain 3 exons unique to Golli-MBP, spliced in-frame to 1 or more MBP exons. They encode hybrid proteins that have N-terminal Golli aa sequence linked to MBP aa sequence. The second family of transcripts contain only MBP exons and produce the well characterized myelin basic proteins. This complex gene structure is conserved among species suggesting that the MBP transcription unit is an integral part of the Golli transcription unit and that this arrangement is important for the function and/or regulation of these genes.","Variant counts

Summary
During the initiation of protein biosynthesis, initiation factor-2 (IF-2) promotes the binding of the initiator tRNA to the small subunit of the ribosome in a GTP-dependent manner. Prokaryotic IF-2 is a single polypeptide, while eukaryotic cytoplasmic IF-2 (eIF-2) is a trimeric protein. Bovine liver mitochondria contain IF-2(mt), an 85-kD monomeric protein that is equivalent to prokaryotic IF-2. The predicted 727-amino acid human protein contains a 29-amino acid presequence. Human IF-2(mt) shares 32 to 38% amino acid sequence identity with yeast IF-2(mt) and several prokaryotic IF-2s, with the greatest degree of conservation in the G domains of the proteins.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene can heterodimerize with mismatch repair endonuclease PMS2 to form MutL alpha, part of the DNA mismatch repair system. When MutL alpha is bound by MutS beta and some accessory proteins, the PMS2 subunit of MutL alpha introduces a single-strand break near DNA mismatches, providing an entry point for exonuclease degradation. The encoded protein is also involved in DNA damage signaling and can heterodimerize with DNA mismatch repair protein MLH3 to form MutL gamma, which is involved in meiosis. This gene was identified as a locus frequently mutated in hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC).","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that belongs to a novel class of zinc finger proteins. The encoded protein functions as a transcriptional co-regulator, and as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that promotes the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of target proteins. The protein encoded by this gene is thought to regulate RNA polymerase II-catalyzed transcription. Substrates for this protein's E3 ubiquitin ligase activity include the capsid protein of the West Nile virus and the catalytic subunit of the telomerase ribonucleoprotein. This protein controls cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by regulating p21, a cell cycle regulator, and the tumor suppressor protein p53. Pseudogenes of this gene are present on chromosomes 1, 3, 9, 12 and 20, and on the X chromosome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are encoded by nuclear genes and help in protein synthesis within the mitochondrion. Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) consist of a small 28S subunit and a large 39S subunit. They have an estimated 75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes, where this ratio is reversed. Another difference between mammalian mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain a 5S rRNA.

Summary
Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are encoded by nuclear genes and help in protein synthesis within the mitochondrion. Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) consist of a small 28S subunit and a large 39S subunit. They have an estimated 75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes, where this ratio is reversed. Another difference between mammalian mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain a 5S rRNA. Among different species, the proteins comprising the mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence homology.

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene was determined by in silico methods to be a mitochondrial protein with similarity to the peptide chain release factors (RFs) discovered in bacteria and yeast. The peptide chain release factors direct the termination of translation in response to the peptide chain termination codons. Initially thought to have a role in the termination of mitochondria protein synthesis, a recent publication found no mitochondrial translation release functionality. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been suggested by mRNA and EST data; however, their full-length natures are not clear.","Variant counts

Summary
Expression of the c-myc gene, which produces an oncogenic transcription factor, is tightly regulated in normal cells but is frequently deregulated in human cancers. The protein encoded by this gene is a transcriptional repressor thought to negatively regulate MYC function, and is therefore a potential tumor suppressor. This protein inhibits the transcriptional activity of MYC by competing for MAX, another basic helix-loop-helix protein that binds to MYC and is required for its function. Defects in this gene are frequently found in patients with prostate tumors. Three alternatively spliced transcripts encoding different isoforms have been described. Additional alternatively spliced transcripts may exist but the products of these transcripts have not been verified experimentally.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the metallothionein family of genes. Proteins encoded by this gene family are low in molecular weight, are cysteine-rich, lack aromatic residues, and bind divalent heavy metal ions, altering the intracellular concentration of heavy metals in the cell. These proteins act as anti-oxidants, protect against hydroxyl free radicals, are important in homeostatic control of metal in the cell, and play a role in detoxification of heavy metals. The encoded protein interacts with the protein encoded by the homeobox containing 1 gene in some cell types, controlling intracellular zinc levels, affecting apoptotic and autophagy pathways. Some polymorphisms in this gene are associated with an increased risk of cancer.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the serine/threonine protein kinase family. This kinase contains a leucine-zipper domain and is predominately expressed in neuronal cells. The phosphorylation state of this kinase in synaptic terminals was shown to be regulated by membrane depolarization via calcineurin. This kinase forms heterodimers with leucine zipper containing transcription factors, such as cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB) and MYC, and thus may play a regulatory role in PKA or retinoic acid induced neuronal differentiation. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different proteins have been described.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a structure-specific endonuclease which belongs to the XPF/MUS81 endonuclease family and plays a critical role in the resolution of recombination intermediates during DNA repair after inter-strand cross-links, replication fork collapse, and DNA double-strand breaks. The encoded protein associates with one of two closely related essential meiotic endonuclease proteins (EME1 or EME2) to form a complex that processes DNA secondary structures. It contains an N-terminal DEAH helicase domain, an excision repair cross complementation group 4 (ERCC4) endonuclease domain, and two tandem C-terminal helix-hairpin-helix domains. Mice with a homozygous knockout of the orthologous gene have significant meiotic defects including the failure to repair a subset of DNA double strand breaks.","Variant counts

Summary
Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are encoded by nuclear genes and help in protein synthesis within the mitochondrion. Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) consist of a small 28S subunit and a large 39S subunit. They have an estimated 75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes, where this ratio is reversed. Another difference between mammalian mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain a 5S rRNA. Among different species, the proteins comprising the mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence homology. This gene encodes a 39S subunit protein. Two transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been described. A pseudogene corresponding to this gene is found on chromosome 5q.","Variant counts

This gene encodes the human homolog of mouse morc and like the mouse protein it is testis-specific. Mouse studies support a testis-specific function since only male knockout mice are infertile; infertility is the only apparent defect. These studies further support a role for this protein early in spermatogenesis, possibly by affecting entry into apoptosis because testis from knockout mice show greatly increased numbers of apoptotic cells.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a 39S subunit protein. Deletions in this gene may contribute to the etiology of velo-cardio-facial syndrome and DiGeorge syndrome.","Variant counts

Summary
Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are encoded by nuclear genes and help in protein synthesis within the mitochondrion. Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) consist of a small 28S subunit and a large 39S subunit. They have an estimated 75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes, where this ratio is reversed. Another difference between mammalian mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain a 5S rRNA. Among different species, the proteins comprising the mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence homology. This gene encodes a 39S subunit protein. This gene is immediately adjacent to the gene for BAF complex 53 kDa subunit protein a (BAF53a), in a tail-to-tail orientation. Two transcript variants encoding different protein isoforms have been identified.","Variant counts

Summary
N-glycosylation of proteins is initiated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the transfer of the preassembled oligosaccharide glucose-3-mannose-9-N-acetylglucosamine-2 from dolichyl pyrophosphate to acceptor sites on the target protein by an oligosaccharyltransferase complex. This core oligosaccharide is sequentially processed by several ER glycosidases and by an endomannosidase (E.C. 3.2.1.130), such as MANEA, in the Golgi. MANEA catalyzes the release of mono-, di-, and triglucosylmannose oligosaccharides by cleaving the alpha-1,2-mannosidic bond that links them to high-mannose glycans (Hamilton et al., 2005 [PubMed 15677381]).","Variant counts

Malic enzyme catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of malate to pyruvate using either NAD+ or NADP+ as a cofactor. Mammalian tissues contain 3 distinct isoforms of malic enzyme: a cytosolic NADP(+)-dependent isoform, a mitochondrial NADP(+)-dependent isoform, and a mitochondrial NAD(+)-dependent isoform. This gene encodes a mitochondrial NADP(+)-dependent isoform. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene, but the biological validity of some variants has not been determined.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a mitochondrial NAD-dependent malic enzyme, a homotetrameric protein, that catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of malate to pyruvate. It had previously been weakly linked to a syndrome known as Friedreich ataxia that has since been shown to be the result of mutation in a completely different gene. Certain single-nucleotide polymorphism haplotypes of this gene have been shown to increase the risk for idiopathic generalized epilepsy. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Thymus development depends on a complex series of interactions between thymocytes and the stromal component of the organ. Epithelial V-like antigen (EVA) is expressed in thymus epithelium and strongly downregulated by thymocyte developmental progression. This gene is expressed in the thymus and in several epithelial structures early in embryogenesis. It is highly homologous to the myelin protein zero and, in thymus-derived epithelial cell lines, is poorly soluble in nonionic detergents, strongly suggesting an association to the cytoskeleton. Its capacity to mediate cell adhesion through a homophilic interaction and its selective regulation by T cell maturation might imply the participation of EVA in the earliest phases of thymus organogenesis. The protein bears a characteristic V-type domain and two potential N-glycosylation sites in the extracellular domain; a putative serine phosphorylation site for casein kinase 2 is also present in the cytoplasmic tail. Two transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the MAGEA gene family. The members of this family encode proteins with 50 to 80% sequence identity to each other. The promoters and first exons of the MAGEA genes show considerable variability, suggesting that the existence of this gene family enables the same function to be expressed under different transcriptional controls. The MAGEA genes are clustered at chromosomal location Xq28. They have been implicated in some hereditary disorders, such as dyskeratosis congenita. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase family of proteins and the product of the proto-oncogene MET. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate alpha and beta subunits that are linked via disulfide bonds to form the mature receptor. Further processing of the beta subunit results in the formation of the M10 peptide, which has been shown to reduce lung fibrosis. Binding of its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor, induces dimerization and activation of the receptor, which plays a role in cellular survival, embryogenesis, and cellular migration and invasion. Mutations in this gene are associated with papillary renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and various head and neck cancers. Amplification and overexpression of this gene are also associated with multiple human cancers.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to a family of phosphatidylinositol kinase-related kinases. These kinases mediate cellular responses to stresses such as DNA damage and nutrient deprivation. This kinase is a component of two distinct complexes, mTORC1, which controls protein synthesis, cell growth and proliferation, and mTORC2, which is a regulator of the actin cytoskeleton, and promotes cell survival and cell cycle progression. This protein acts as the target for the cell-cycle arrest and immunosuppressive effects of the FKBP12-rapamycin complex. Inhibitors of mTOR are used in organ transplants as immunosuppressants, and are being evaluated for their therapeutic potential in SARS-CoV-2 infections. Mutations in this gene are associated with Smith-Kingsmore syndrome and somatic focal cortical dysplasia type II. The ANGPTL7 gene is located in an intron of this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a nuclear protein involved in homologous recombination, telomere length maintenance, and DNA double-strand break repair. By itself, the protein has 3' to 5' exonuclease activity and endonuclease activity. The protein forms a complex with the RAD50 homolog; this complex is required for nonhomologous joining of DNA ends and possesses increased single-stranded DNA endonuclease and 3' to 5' exonuclease activities. In conjunction with a DNA ligase, this protein promotes the joining of noncomplementary ends in vitro using short homologies near the ends of the DNA fragments. This gene has a pseudogene on chromosome 3. Alternative splicing of this gene results in two transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a nonsarcomeric myosin regulatory light chain. This protein is activated by phosphorylation and regulates smooth muscle and non-muscle cell contraction. This protein may also be involved in DNA damage repair by sequestering the transcriptional regulator apoptosis-antagonizing transcription factor (AATF)/Che-1 which functions as a repressor of p53-driven apoptosis. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants. A pseudogene of this gene is found on chromosome 8.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the MAP kinase family. MAP kinases act as an integration point for multiple biochemical signals, and are involved in a wide variety of cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, transcription regulation and development. This kinase is activated by various environmental stresses and proinflammatory cytokines. The activation requires its phosphorylation by MAP kinase kinases (MKKs), or its autophosphorylation triggered by the interaction of MAP3K7IP1/TAB1 protein with this kinase. The substrates of this kinase include transcription regulator ATF2, MEF2C, and MAX, cell cycle regulator CDC25B, and tumor suppressor p53, which suggest the roles of this kinase in stress related transcription and cell cycle regulation, as well as in genotoxic stress response. Four alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene encoding distinct isoforms have been reported.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the MAP kinase family. MAP kinases act as integration points for multiple biochemical signals, and thus are involved in a wide variety of cellular processes, such as proliferation, differentiation, transcription regulation and development. This kinase is specifically expressed in a subset of neurons in the nervous system, and is activated by threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation. Targeted deletion of this gene in mice suggests that it may have a role in stress-induced neuronal apoptosis. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene. A recent study provided evidence for translational readthrough in this gene, and expression of an additional C-terminally extended isoform via the use of an alternative in-frame translation termination codon.","Variant counts

The encoded protein interacts with another related JNK pathway scaffold protein, WDR62, via a conserved dimerization domain, and enhances JNK signaling. This protein may play a role in bacterial immunity by binding to the NOD2 receptor and negatively regulating downstream antibacterial and pro-inflammatory signaling. Mutations in this gene that impair cellular localization of the encoded protein cause a form of nephronophthisis, an autosomal-recessive kidney disorder, in human patients.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene contains four kringle domains and a serine protease domain, similar to that found in hepatic growth factor. Despite the presence of the serine protease domain, the encoded protein may not have any proteolytic activity. The receptor for this protein is RON tyrosine kinase, which upon activation stimulates ciliary motility of ciliated epithelial lung cells. This protein is secreted and cleaved to form an alpha chain and a beta chain bridged by disulfide bonds.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a secreted ligand of the TGF-beta (transforming growth factor-beta) superfamily of proteins. Ligands of this family bind various TGF-beta receptors leading to recruitment and activation of SMAD family transcription factors that regulate gene expression. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate each subunit of the disulfide-linked homodimer. This protein negatively regulates skeletal muscle cell proliferation and differentiation. Mutations in this gene are associated with increased skeletal muscle mass in humans and other mammals.","Variant counts

This gene is a member of the metallothionein family of genes. Proteins encoded by this gene family are low in molecular weight, are cysteine-rich, lack aromatic residues, and bind divalent heavy metal ions. The conserved cysteine residues co-ordinate metal ions using mercaptide linkages. These proteins act as anti-oxidants, protect against hydroxyl free radicals, are important in homeostatic control of metal in the cell, and play a role in detoxification of heavy metals. Disruption of two metallothionein genes in mouse resulted in defects in protection against heavy metals, oxidative stress, immune reactions, carcinogens, and displayed obesity.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the glycosyltransferase family. It catalyzes the addition of beta-1,6-N-acetylglucosamine to the alpha-linked mannose of biantennary N-linked oligosaccharides present on the newly synthesized glycoproteins. It is one of the most important enzymes involved in the regulation of the biosynthesis of glycoprotein oligosaccharides. Alterations of the oligosaccharides on cell surface glycoproteins cause significant changes in the adhesive or migratory behavior of a cell. Increase in the activity of this enzyme has been correlated with the progression of invasive malignancies.","Variant counts

Proteins in this family are involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix in normal physiological processes, such as embryonic development, reproduction, and tissue remodeling, as well as in disease processes, such as arthritis and metastasis. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate the mature protease. This secreted protease breaks down proteoglycans, fibronectin, elastin and casein and differs from most MMP family members in that it lacks a conserved C-terminal hemopexin domain. The enzyme is involved in wound healing, and studies in mice suggest that it regulates the activity of defensins in intestinal mucosa. The gene is part of a cluster of MMP genes on chromosome 11. This gene exhibits elevated expression levels in multiple human cancers.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) gene family, that are zinc-dependent enzymes capable of cleaving components of the extracellular matrix and molecules involved in signal transduction. The protein encoded by this gene is a gelatinase A, type IV collagenase, that contains three fibronectin type II repeats in its catalytic site that allow binding of denatured type IV and V collagen and elastin. Unlike most MMP family members, activation of this protein can occur on the cell membrane. This enzyme can be activated extracellularly by proteases, or, intracellulary by its S-glutathiolation with no requirement for proteolytical removal of the pro-domain. This protein is thought to be involved in multiple pathways including roles in the nervous system, endometrial menstrual breakdown, regulation of vascularization, and metastasis. Mutations in this gene have been associated with Winchester syndrome and Nodulosis-Arthropathy-Osteolysis (NAO) syndrome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

This gene encodes an enzyme which degrades fibronectin, laminin, collagens III, IV, IX, and X, and cartilage proteoglycans. The enzyme is thought to be involved in wound repair, progression of atherosclerosis, and tumor initiation. The gene is part of a cluster of MMP genes which localize to chromosome 11q22.3.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the peptidase M10 family of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Proteins in this family are involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix in normal physiological processes, such as embryonic development, reproduction, and tissue remodeling, as well as in disease processes, such as arthritis and metastasis. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate the mature protease. This secreted protease breaks down the interstitial collagens, including types I, II, and III. The gene is part of a cluster of MMP genes on chromosome 11. Mutations in this gene are associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, at least one of which encodes an isoform that is proteolytically processed.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes an enzyme that hydrolyzes terminal, non-reducing alpha-D-mannose residues in alpha-D-mannosides. Its activity is necessary for the catabolism of N-linked carbohydrates released during glycoprotein turnover and it is member of family 38 of glycosyl hydrolases. The full length protein is processed in two steps. First, a 49 aa leader sequence is cleaved off and the remainder of the protein is processed into 3 peptides of 70 kDa, 42 kDa (D) and 13/15 kDa (E). Next, the 70 kDa peptide is further processed into three peptides (A, B and C). The A, B and C peptides are disulfide-linked. Defects in this gene have been associated with lysosomal alpha-mannosidosis. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a regulator of the pancreatic beta-cell function. It is highly similar to JIP-1, a mouse protein known to be a regulator of c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (Mapk8). This protein has been shown to prevent MAPK8 mediated activation of transcription factors, and to decrease IL-1 beta and MAP kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1) induced apoptosis in pancreatic beta cells. This protein also functions as a DNA-binding transactivator of the glucose transporter GLUT2. RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST) is reported to repress the expression of this gene in insulin-secreting beta cells. This gene is found to be mutated in a type 2 diabetes family, and thus is thought to be a susceptibility gene for type 2 diabetes.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene shares similarity with the product of Drosophila syd gene, required for the functional interaction of kinesin I with axonal cargo. Studies of the similar gene in mouse suggested that this protein may interact with, and regulate the activity of numerous protein kinases of the JNK signaling pathway, and thus function as a scaffold protein in neuronal cells. The C. elegans counterpart of this gene is found to regulate synaptic vesicle transport possibly by integrating JNK signaling and kinesin-1 transport. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been described, but the full-length nature of some of these variants has not been determined.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the ferredoxin-NADP(+) reductase (FNR) family of electron transferases. This protein functions in the synthesis of methionine by regenerating methionine synthase to a functional state. Because methionine synthesis requires methyl-group transfer by a folate donor, activity of the encoded enzyme is important for folate metabolism and cellular methylation. Mutations in this gene can cause homocystinuria-megaloblastic anemia, cbl E type. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a nuclear protein that is similar to the product of the Drosophila male-specific lethal-3 gene. The Drosophila protein plays a critical role in a dosage-compensation pathway, which equalizes X-linked gene expression in males and females. Thus, the human protein is thought to play a similar function in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation, and it has been found as part of a complex that is responsible for histone H4 lysine-16 acetylation. This gene can undergo X inactivation. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Related pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes 2, 7 and 8.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a preproprotein that is proteolytically processed to generate two protein products, megakaryocyte potentiating factor and mesothelin. Megakaryocyte potentiating factor functions as a cytokine that can stimulate colony formation of bone marrow megakaryocytes. Mesothelin is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell-surface protein that may function as a cell adhesion protein. This protein is overexpressed in epithelial mesotheliomas, ovarian cancers and in specific squamous cell carcinomas. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, at least one of which encodes an isoform that is proteolytically processed.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the glycosyltransferase 31 gene family. Members of this gene family, which also includes the LFNG (GeneID: 3955) and RFNG (GeneID: 5986) genes, encode evolutionarily conserved glycosyltransferases that act in the Notch signaling pathway to define boundaries during embryonic development. While their genomic structure is distinct from other glycosyltransferases, these proteins have a fucose-specific beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity that leads to elongation of O-linked fucose residues on Notch, which alters Notch signaling. The protein encoded by this gene may control Notch signaling in claudin-low breast cancer.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene belongs to the protein kinase superfamily. The encoded protein contains a protein kinase-like domain; however, is thought to be inactive because it lacks several residues required for activity. This protein plays a critical role in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced necroptosis, a programmed cell death process, via interaction with receptor-interacting protein 3 (RIP3), which is a key signaling molecule in necroptosis pathway. Inhibitor studies and knockdown of this gene inhibited TNF-induced necrosis. High levels of this protein and RIP3 are associated with inflammatory bowel disease in children. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein which shares sequence similarity with other members of the type II chaperonin family. The encoded protein is a centrosome-shuttling protein and plays an important role in cytokinesis. This protein also interacts with other type II chaperonin members to form a complex known as the BBSome, which involves ciliary membrane biogenesis. This protein is encoded by a downstream open reading frame (dORF). Several upstream open reading frames (uORFs) have been identified, which repress the translation of the dORF, and two of which can encode small mitochondrial membrane proteins. Mutations in this gene have been observed in patients with Bardet-Biedl syndrome type 6, also known as McKusick-Kaufman syndrome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the alpha/beta hydrolase superfamily. It is imprinted, exhibiting preferential expression from the paternal allele in fetal tissues, and isoform-specific imprinting in lymphocytes. The loss of imprinting of this gene has been linked to certain types of cancer and may be due to promotor switching. The encoded protein may play a role in development. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been identified for this gene. Pseudogenes of this gene are located on the short arm of chromosomes 3 and 4, and the long arm of chromosomes 6 and 15.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a cell surface receptor for macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP) with tyrosine kinase activity. The mature form of this protein is a heterodimer of disulfide-linked alpha and beta subunits, generated by proteolytic cleavage of a single-chain precursor. The beta subunit undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation upon stimulation by MSP. This protein is expressed on the ciliated epithelia of the mucociliary transport apparatus of the lung, and together with MSP, thought to be involved in host defense. Alternative splicing generates multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms that may undergo similar proteolytic processing.","Variant counts

Summary
Proteins of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family are involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix in normal physiological processes, such as embryonic development, reproduction, and tissue remodeling, as well as in disease processes, such as arthritis and metastasis. Most MMP's are secreted as inactive proproteins which are activated when cleaved by extracellular proteinases. However, the protein encoded by this gene is a member of the membrane-type MMP (MT-MMP) subfamily; each member of this subfamily contains a potential transmembrane domain suggesting that these proteins are expressed at the cell surface rather than secreted. This protein activates MMP2 protein, and this activity may be involved in tumor invasion.","Variant counts

Summary
The exact function of the protein encoded by this gene is not known, however, its C-terminal region shows similarity to TonB, a bacterial protein involved in energy transduction for cobalamin (vitamin B12) uptake. Hence, it is postulated that this protein may have a role in the binding and intracellular trafficking of cobalamin. Mutations in this gene are associated with methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria type cblC.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to a family of sarcomeric proteins that bind to calcineurin, a phosphatase involved in calcium-dependent signal transduction in diverse cell types. These family members tether calcineurin to alpha-actinin at the z-line of the sarcomere of cardiac and skeletal muscle cells, and thus they are important for calcineurin signaling. Mutations in this gene cause cardiomyopathy familial hypertrophic type 16, a hereditary heart disorder.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the serine/threonine protein kinase family. This kinase has been shown to specifically activate MAPK8/JNK. The activation of MAPK8 by this kinase is found to be inhibited by the dominant-negative mutants of MAP3K7/TAK1, MAP2K4/MKK4, and MAP2K7/MKK7, which suggests that this kinase may function through the MAP3K7-MAP2K4-MAP2K7 kinase cascade, and mediate the TNF-alpha signaling pathway. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified.","Variant counts

Mutations in this gene cause methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria type cblD (MMADHC), a disorder of cobalamin metabolism that is characterized by decreased levels of the coenzymes adenosylcobalamin and methylcobalamin. Pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes 11 and X.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene forms a complex with tonsoku-like, DNA repair protein (TONSL), and this complex recognizes and repairs DNA double-strand breaks at sites of stalled or collapsed replication forks. The encoded protein also can bind with the histone-associated protein NFKBIL2 to help regulate the chromatin state at stalled replication forks. Finally, this gene appears to be overexpressed in most lung and esophageal cancers. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The activation of gene transcription is a multistep process that is triggered by factors that recognize transcriptional enhancer sites in DNA. These factors work with co-activators to direct transcriptional initiation by the RNA polymerase II apparatus. The protein encoded by this gene is a subunit of the CRSP (cofactor required for SP1 activation) complex, which, along with TFIID, is required for efficient activation by SP1. This protein is also a component of other multisubunit complexes e.g. thyroid hormone receptor-(TR-) associated proteins which interact with TR and facilitate TR function on DNA templates in conjunction with initiation factors and cofactors. It also regulates p53-dependent apoptosis and it is essential for adipogenesis. This protein is known to have the ability to self-oligomerize.","Variant counts

Summary
The developmentally regulated expression of the globin genes depends on upstream regulatory elements termed locus control regions (LCRs). LCRs are associated with powerful enhancer activity that is mediated by the transcription factor NFE2 (nuclear factor erythroid-2). NFE2 recognition sites are also present in the gene promoters of 2 heme biosynthetic enzymes, porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD; MIM 609806) and ferrochelatase (FECH; MIM 612386). NFE2 DNA-binding activity consists of a heterodimer containing an 18-kD Maf protein (MafF, MafG (MIM 602020), or MafK) and p45 (MIM 601490). Both subunits are members of the activator protein-1 superfamily of basic leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins (see MIM 165160). Maf homodimers suppress transcription at NFE2 sites.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor that lacks a transactivation domain. It is known to bind the US-2 DNA element in the promoter of the oxytocin receptor (OTR) gene and most likely heterodimerizes with other leucine zipper-containing proteins to enhance expression of the OTR gene during term pregnancy. The encoded protein can also form homodimers, and since it lacks a transactivation domain, the homodimer may act as a repressor of transcription. This gene may also be involved in the cellular stress response. Multiple transcript variants encoding two different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Globin gene expression is regulated through nuclear factor erythroid-2 (NFE2) elements located in enhancer-like locus control regions positioned many kb upstream of alpha- and beta-gene clusters (summarized by Blank et al., 1997 [PubMed 9166829]). NFE2 DNA-binding activity consists of a heterodimer containing a ubiquitous small Maf protein (MafF, MIM 604877; MafG; or MafK, MIM 600197) and the tissue-restricted protein p45 NFE2 (MIM 601490). Both subunits are members of the activator protein-1-like superfamily of basic leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins (see MIM 165160).","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes the highly polymorphic major histocompatability complex class I chain-related protein A. The protein product is expressed on the cell surface, although unlike canonical class I molecules it does not seem to associate with beta-2-microglobulin. It is a ligand for the NKG2-D type II integral membrane protein receptor. The protein functions as a stress-induced antigen that is broadly recognized by intestinal epithelial gamma delta T cells. Variations in this gene have been associated with susceptibility to psoriasis 1 and psoriatic arthritis, and the shedding of MICA-related antibodies and ligands is involved in the progression from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance to multiple myeloma. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is an oncogene that encodes a member of the serine/threonine protein kinase family. The encoded protein localizes to the cytoplasm and can activate both the MAP kinase and JNK kinase pathways. This protein was shown to activate IkappaB kinases, and thus induce the nuclear production of NF-kappaB. This protein was also found to promote the production of TNF-alpha and IL-2 during T lymphocyte activation. This gene may also utilize a downstream in-frame translation start codon, and thus produce an isoform containing a shorter N-terminus. The shorter isoform has been shown to display weaker transforming activity. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants that encode the same protein.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene product is a 626-amino acid polypeptide that is 96.5% identical to mouse Mekk3. Its catalytic domain is closely related to those of several other kinases, including mouse Mekk2, tobacco NPK, and yeast Ste11. Northern blot analysis revealed a 4.6-kb transcript that appears to be ubiquitously expressed. This protein directly regulates the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) pathways by activating SEK and MEK1/2 respectively; it does not regulate the p38 pathway. In cotransfection assays, it enhanced transcription from a nuclear factor kappa-B (NFKB)-dependent reporter gene, consistent with a role in the SAPK pathway. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been observed.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the serine/threonine protein kinase family. This kinase mediates the signaling transduction induced by TGF beta and morphogenetic protein (BMP), and controls a variety of cell functions including transcription regulation and apoptosis. In response to IL-1, this protein forms a kinase complex including TRAF6, MAP3K7P1/TAB1 and MAP3K7P2/TAB2; this complex is required for the activation of nuclear factor kappa B. This kinase can also activate MAPK8/JNK, MAP2K4/MKK4, and thus plays a role in the cell response to environmental stresses. Four alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been reported.","Variant counts

Summary
The central core of each mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is a conserved cascade of 3 protein kinases: an activated MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK) phosphorylates and activates a specific MAPK kinase (MAPKK), which then activates a specific MAPK. While the ERK MAPKs are activated by mitogenic stimulation, the CSBP2 and JNK MAPKs are activated by environmental stresses such as osmotic shock, UV irradiation, wound stress, and inflammatory factors. This gene encodes a MAPKKK, the MEKK4 protein, also called MTK1. This protein contains a protein kinase catalytic domain at the C terminus. The N-terminal nonkinase domain may contain a regulatory domain. Expression of MEKK4 in mammalian cells activated the CSBP2 and JNK MAPK pathways, but not the ERK pathway. In vitro kinase studies indicated that recombinant MEKK4 can specifically phosphorylate and activate PRKMK6 and SERK1, MAPKKs that activate CSBP2 and JNK, respectively but cannot phosphorylate PRKMK1, an MAPKK that activates ERKs. MEKK4 is a major mediator of environmental stresses that activate the CSBP2 MAPK pathway, and a minor mediator of the JNK pathway. Several alternatively spliced transcripts encoding distinct isoforms have been described.","Variant counts

Summary
Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades include MAPK or extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), MAPK kinase (MKK or MEK), and MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK or MEKK). MAPKK kinase/MEKK phosphorylates and activates its downstream protein kinase, MAPK kinase/MEK, which in turn activates MAPK. The kinases of these signaling cascades are highly conserved, and homologs exist in yeast, Drosophila, and mammalian cells. MAPKKK5 contains 1,374 amino acids with all 11 kinase subdomains. Northern blot analysis shows that MAPKKK5 transcript is abundantly expressed in human heart and pancreas. The MAPKKK5 protein phosphorylates and activates MKK4 (aliases SERK1, MAPKK4) in vitro, and activates c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) during transient expression in COS and 293 cells; MAPKKK5 does not activate MAPK/ERK.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the myosin family of actin-based molecular motor heavy chain proteins. The protein represents an unconventional myosin; it should not be confused with the conventional non-muscle myosin-9 (MYH9). The protein has four IQ motifs located in the neck domain that bind calmodulin, which serves as a light chain. The protein complex has a single-headed structure and exhibits processive movement on actin filaments toward the minus-end. The protein also has rho-GTPase activity. Polymorphisms in this gene are associated with celiac disease and ulcerative colitis susceptibility. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the myosin superfamily. The protein represents an unconventional myosin; it should not be confused with the conventional non-muscle myosin-9 (MYH9). Unconventional myosins contain the basic domains of conventional myosins and are further distinguished from class members by their tail domains. They function as actin-based molecular motors. Mutations in this gene have been associated with Bardet-Biedl Syndrome.","Variant counts

MC2R encodes one member of the five-member G-protein associated melanocortin receptor family. Melanocortins (melanocyte-stimulating hormones and adrenocorticotropic hormone) are peptides derived from pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC). MC2R is selectively activated by adrenocorticotropic hormone, whereas the other four melanocortin receptors recognize a variety of melanocortin ligands. Mutations in MC2R can result in familial glucocorticoid deficiency. Alternate transcript variants have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and golgi, and is also secreted. Reducing expression of this gene increases susceptibility to ER stress-induced death and results in cell proliferation. Activity of this protein is important in promoting the survival of dopaminergic neurons. The presence of polymorphisms in the N-terminal arginine-rich region, including a specific mutation that changes an ATG start codon to AGG, have been reported in a variety of solid tumors; however, these polymorphisms were later shown to exist in normal tissues and are thus no longer thought to be tumor-related.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) protein family, with an N-terminal PDZ domain, a central src homology 3 region (SH3), and a C-terminal guanylate kinase-like (GUK) domain. The protein is localized to the outer limiting membrane in the retina, and is thought to function in photoreceptor polarity and the organization of specialized intercellular junctions. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described, but their biological validity has not been determined.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene, a muscle member of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily, encodes myosin light chain kinase which is a calcium/calmodulin dependent enzyme. This kinase phosphorylates myosin regulatory light chains to facilitate myosin interaction with actin filaments to produce contractile activity. This gene encodes both smooth muscle and nonmuscle isoforms. In addition, using a separate promoter in an intron in the 3' region, it encodes telokin, a small protein identical in sequence to the C-terminus of myosin light chain kinase, that is independently expressed in smooth muscle and functions to stabilize unphosphorylated myosin filaments. A pseudogene is located on the p arm of chromosome 3. Four transcript variants that produce four isoforms of the calcium/calmodulin dependent enzyme have been identified as well as two transcripts that produce two isoforms of telokin. Additional variants have been identified but lack full length transcripts.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a dual specificity protein kinase that belongs to the MAP kinase kinase family. This kinase is activated by mitogenic and environmental stress, and participates in the MAP kinase-mediated signaling cascade. It phosphorylates and thus activates MAPK14/p38-MAPK. This kinase can be activated by insulin, and is necessary for the expression of glucose transporter. Expression of RAS oncogene is found to result in the accumulation of the active form of this kinase, which thus leads to the constitutive activation of MAPK14, and confers oncogenic transformation of primary cells. The inhibition of this kinase is involved in the pathogenesis of Yersina pseudotuberculosis. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants that encode distinct isoforms have been reported for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a dual specificity protein kinase that belongs to the MAP kinase kinase family. This kinase is known to play a critical role in mitogen growth factor signal transduction. It phosphorylates and thus activates MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK2/ERK3. The activation of this kinase itself is dependent on the Ser/Thr phosphorylation by MAP kinase kinase kinases. Mutations in this gene cause cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome (CFC syndrome), a disease characterized by heart defects, cognitive disability, and distinctive facial features similar to those found in Noonan syndrome. The inhibition or degradation of this kinase is also found to be involved in the pathogenesis of Yersinia and anthrax. A pseudogene, which is located on chromosome 7, has been identified for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is caused by the loss of expression of imprinted genes in chromosome 15q11-q13 region. Affected individuals exhibit neonatal hypotonia, developmental delay, and childhood-onset obesity. Necdin (NDN), a gene involved in the terminal differentiation of neurons, localizes to this region of the genome and has been implicated as one of the genes responsible for the etiology of PWS. This gene is structurally similar to NDN, is also localized to the PWS chromosomal region, and is paternally imprinted, suggesting a possible role for it in PWS.","Variant counts

Summary
Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are encoded by nuclear genes and help in protein synthesis within the mitochondrion. Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) consist of a small 28S subunit and a large 39S subunit. They have an estimated 75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes, where this ratio is reversed. Another difference between mammalian mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain a 5S rRNA. Among different species, the proteins comprising the mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence homology. This gene encodes a 39S subunit protein which is more than twice the size of its E.coli counterpart (EcoL24). Sequence analysis identified two transcript variants that encode the same protein.","Variant counts

Summary
Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are encoded by nuclear genes and help in protein synthesis within the mitochondrion. Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) consist of a small 28S subunit and a large 39S subunit. They have an estimated 75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes, where this ratio is reversed. Another difference between mammalian mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain a 5S rRNA. Among different species, the proteins comprising the mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence homology. This gene encodes a 39S subunit protein.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the nonmuscle class I myosins which are a subgroup of the unconventional myosin protein family. The unconventional myosin proteins function as actin-based molecular motors. Class I myosins are characterized by a head (motor) domain, a regulatory domain and a either a short or long tail domain. Among the class I myosins, this protein is distinguished by a long tail domain that is involved in crosslinking actin filaments. This protein localizes to the cytoplasm and may be involved in intracellular movement and membrane trafficking. Mutations in this gene are the cause of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis-6. This gene has been referred to as myosin IC in the literature but is distinct from the myosin IC gene located on chromosome 17.","Variant counts

The protein is found in the cytoplasm, and one isoform with a unique N-terminus is also found in the nucleus. The nuclear isoform associates with RNA polymerase I and II and functions in transcription initiation. The mouse ortholog of this protein also functions in intracellular vesicle transport to the plasma membrane. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. The related gene myosin IE has been referred to as myosin IC in the literature, but it is a distinct locus on chromosome 19.","Variant counts

Summary
The product of this gene catalyzes the breakdown of malonyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA and carbon dioxide. Malonyl-CoA is an intermediate in fatty acid biosynthesis, and also inhibits the transport of fatty acyl CoAs into mitochondria. Consequently, the encoded protein acts to increase the rate of fatty acid oxidation. It is found in mitochondria, peroxisomes, and the cytoplasm. Mutations in this gene result in malonyl-CoA decarboyxlase deficiency.","Variant counts

Summary
In 1990 an oncogene, v-mpl, was identified from the murine myeloproliferative leukemia virus that was capable of immortalizing bone marrow hematopoietic cells from different lineages. In 1992 the human homologue, named, c-mpl, was cloned. Sequence data revealed that c-mpl encoded a protein that was homologous with members of the hematopoietic receptor superfamily. Presence of anti-sense oligodeoxynucleotides of c-mpl inhibited megakaryocyte colony formation. The ligand for c-mpl, thrombopoietin, was cloned in 1994. Thrombopoietin was shown to be the major regulator of megakaryocytopoiesis and platelet formation. The protein encoded by the c-mpl gene, CD110, is a 635 amino acid transmembrane domain, with two extracellular cytokine receptor domains and two intracellular cytokine receptor box motifs . TPO-R deficient mice were severely thrombocytopenic, emphasizing the important role of CD110 and thrombopoietin in megakaryocyte and platelet formation. Upon binding of thrombopoietin CD110 is dimerized and the JAK family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, as well as the STAT family, the MAPK family, the adaptor protein Shc and the receptors themselves become tyrosine phosphorylated.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is specifically expressed in Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system and encodes a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that is a major structural protein of the peripheral myelin sheath. The encoded protein contains a large hydrophobic extracellular domain and a smaller basic intracellular domain, which are essential for the formation and stabilization of the multilamellar structure of the compact myelin. Mutations in this gene are associated with autosomal dominant form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1 (CMT1B) and other polyneuropathies, such as Dejerine-Sottas syndrome (DSS) and congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy (CHN). A recent study showed that two isoforms are produced from the same mRNA by use of alternative in-frame translation termination codons via a stop codon readthrough mechanism.","Variant counts

Summary
Proteins of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family are involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix in normal physiological processes, such as embryonic development, reproduction, and tissue remodeling, as well as in disease processes, such as arthritis and metastasis. Most MMPs are secreted as inactive proproteins which are activated when cleaved by extracellular proteinases. However, the protein encoded by this gene is a member of the membrane-type MMP (MT-MMP) subfamily, attached to the plasma membrane via a glycosylphosphatidyl inositol anchor. In response to bacterial infection or inflammation, the encoded protein is thought to inactivate alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor, a major tissue protectant against proteolytic enzymes released by activated neutrophils, facilitating the transendothelial migration of neutrophils to inflammatory sites. The encoded protein may also play a role in tumor invasion and metastasis through activation of MMP2. The gene has previously been referred to as MMP20 but has been renamed MMP25.","Variant counts

Proteins in this family are involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix in normal physiological processes, such as embryonic development, reproduction, and tissue remodeling, as well as in disease processes, such as arthritis and metastasis. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate the mature protease. Unlike most MMPs, which are secreted, this protease is a member of the membrane-type MMP (MT-MMP) subfamily, contains a transmembrane domain and is expressed at the cell surface. Substrates of this protease include the proteins cadherin 2 and matrix metallopeptidase 2 (also known as 72 kDa type IV collagenase). The gene has previously been referred to as MMP25 but has been renamed matrix metallopeptidase 24 (MMP24).","Variant counts

Summary
Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are encoded by nuclear genes and help in protein synthesis within the mitochondrion. Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) consist of a small 28S subunit and a large 39S subunit. They have an estimated 75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes, where this ratio is reversed. Another difference between mammalian mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain a 5S rRNA. Among different species, the proteins comprising the mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence homology. This gene encodes a 28S subunit protein. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the MAGED gene family. The MAGED genes are clustered on chromosome Xp11. This gene is located in Xp11.2, a hot spot for X-linked intellectual disability (XLID). Mutations in this gene cause a form of transient antenatal Bartter's syndrome. This gene may also be involved in several types of cancer, including breast cancer and melanoma. The protein encoded by this gene is progressively recruited from the cytoplasm to the nucleoplasm during the interphase and after nucleolar stress and is thus thought to play a role in cell cycle regulation. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a nuclear protein that contains a p53 binding domain at the N-terminus and a RING finger domain at the C-terminus, and shows structural similarity to p53-binding protein MDM2. Both proteins bind the p53 tumor suppressor protein and inhibit its activity, and have been shown to be overexpressed in a variety of human cancers. However, unlike MDM2 which degrades p53, this protein inhibits p53 by binding its transcriptional activation domain. This protein also interacts with MDM2 protein via the RING finger domain, and inhibits the latter's degradation. So this protein can reverse MDM2-targeted degradation of p53, while maintaining suppression of p53 transactivation and apoptotic functions. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been noted for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that was identified in a screen for genes expressed in metastatic cells, specifically, mammary adenocarcinoma cell lines. Expression of this gene has been correlated with the metastatic potential of at least two types of carcinomas although it is also expressed in many normal tissues. The role it plays in metastasis is unclear. It was initially thought to be the 70kD component of a nucleosome remodeling deacetylase complex, NuRD, but it is more likely that this component is a different but very similar protein. These two proteins are so closely related, though, that they share the same types of domains. These domains include two DNA binding domains, a dimerization domain, and a domain commonly found in proteins that methylate DNA. The profile and activity of this gene product suggest that it is involved in regulating transcription and that this may be accomplished by chromatin remodeling. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a protein that has been identified as a component of NuRD, a nucleosome remodeling deacetylase complex identified in the nucleus of human cells. It shows a very broad expression pattern and is strongly expressed in many tissues. It may represent one member of a small gene family that encode different but related proteins involved either directly or indirectly in transcriptional regulation. Their indirect effects on transcriptional regulation may include chromatin remodeling. It is closely related to another member of this family, a protein that has been correlated with the metastatic potential of certain carcinomas. These two proteins are so closely related that they share the same types of domains. These domains include two DNA binding domains, a dimerization domain, and a domain commonly found in proteins that methylate DNA. One of the proteins known to be a target protein for this gene product is p53. Deacetylation of p53 is correlated with a loss of growth inhibition in transformed cells supporting a connection between these gene family members and metastasis.","Variant counts

The encoded enzyme is deficient in many cancers because this gene and the tumor suppressor p16 gene are co-deleted. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described for this gene, but their full-length natures remain unknown.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the methionine-R-sulfoxide reductase B (MsrB) family. Members of this family function as repair enzymes that protect proteins from oxidative stress by catalyzing the reduction of methionine-R-sulfoxides to methionines. This protein is highly expressed in liver and kidney, and is localized to the nucleus and cytosol. It is the only member of the MsrB family that is a selenoprotein, containing a selenocysteine (Sec) residue at its active site. It also has the highest methionine-R-sulfoxide reductase activity compared to other members containing cysteine in place of Sec. Sec is encoded by the UGA codon, which normally signals translation termination. The 3' UTRs of selenoprotein mRNAs contain a conserved stem-loop structure, designated the Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element, that is necessary for the recognition of UGA as a Sec codon, rather than as a stop signal. A pseudogene of this locus has been identified on chromosome 19.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the subtilisin-like proprotein convertase family, which includes proteases that process protein and peptide precursors trafficking through regulated or constitutive branches of the secretory pathway. The encoded protein undergoes an initial autocatalytic processing event in the ER to generate a heterodimer which exits the ER and sorts to the cis/medial-Golgi where a second autocatalytic event takes place and the catalytic activity is acquired. It encodes a type 1 membrane bound protease which is ubiquitously expressed and regulates cholesterol or lipid homeostasis via cleavage of substrates at non-basic residues. Mutations in this gene may be associated with lysosomal dysfunction.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene product is a member of a family of proteins characterized by a specific cysteine-rich C-terminal domain, which is involved in transcriptional regulation of viral genome expression. Alternative translation initiation from an upstream non-AUG (GUG), and an in-frame, downstream AUG codon, results in the production of two isoforms, p40 and p32, respectively, which have different subcellular localization; p32 is mainly found in the cytoplasm, whereas p40 is targeted to the nucleolus. Both isoforms have transcriptional regulatory activity that is attributable to the cysteine-rich C-terminal domain. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the serine/threonine protein kinase family. Although this kinase is found in many tissues, its expression in lymphoid follicles is restricted to the cells of germinal centre, where it may participate in B-cell differentiation. This kinase can be activated by TNF-alpha, and has been shown to specifically activate MAP kinases. This kinase is also found to interact with TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), which is involved in the activation of MAP3K1/MEKK1. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a mitochondrial transcription termination factor. This protein participates in attenuating transcription from the mitochondrial genome; this attenuation allows higher levels of expression of 16S ribosomal RNA relative to the tRNA gene downstream. The product of this gene has three leucine zipper motifs bracketed by two basic domains that are all required for DNA binding. There is evidence that, for this protein, the zippers participate in intramolecular interactions that establish the three-dimensional structure required for DNA binding.","Variant counts

Summary
The giant protein titin, together with its associated proteins, interconnects the major structure of sarcomeres, the M bands and Z discs. The C-terminal end of the titin string extends into the M line, where it binds tightly to M-band constituents of apparent molecular masses of 190 kD and 165 kD. The predicted MYOM2 protein contains 1,465 amino acids. Like MYOM1, MYOM2 has a unique N-terminal domain followed by 12 repeat domains with strong homology to either fibronectin type III or immunoglobulin C2 domains. Protein sequence comparisons suggested that the MYOM2 protein and bovine M protein are identical.","Variant counts

Summary
The giant protein titin, together with its associated proteins, interconnects the major structure of sarcomeres, the M bands and Z discs. The C-terminal end of the titin string extends into the M line, where it binds tightly to M-band constituents of apparent molecular masses of 190 kD (myomesin 1) and 165 kD (myomesin 2). This protein, myomesin 1, like myomesin 2, titin, and other myofibrillar proteins contains structural modules with strong homology to either fibronectin type III (motif I) or immunoglobulin C2 (motif II) domains. Myomesin 1 and myomesin 2 each have a unique N-terminal region followed by 12 modules of motif I or motif II, in the arrangement II-II-I-I-I-I-I-II-II-II-II-II. The two proteins share 50% sequence identity in this repeat-containing region. The head structure formed by these 2 proteins on one end of the titin string extends into the center of the M band. The integrating structure of the sarcomere arises from muscle-specific members of the superfamily of immunoglobulin-like proteins. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family, also known as the 'RING-B box-coiled coil' (RBCC) subgroup of RING finger proteins. The TRIM motif includes three zinc-binding domains, a RING, a B-box type 1 and a B-box type 2, and a coiled-coil region. This protein forms homodimers which associate with microtubules in the cytoplasm. The protein is likely involved in the formation of multiprotein structures acting as anchor points to microtubules. Mutations in this gene have been associated with the X-linked form of Opitz syndrome, which is characterized by midline abnormalities such as cleft lip, laryngeal cleft, heart defects, hypospadias, and agenesis of the corpus callosum. This gene was also the first example of a gene subject to X inactivation in human while escaping it in mouse. Alternative promoter use, alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation result in multiple transcript variants that have different tissue specificities.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a conserved protein that features multiple MAM (meprin-A5-protein tyrosine phosphatase mu) and LDLR A2 (low density lipoprotein receptor A2) domains. Expression of this gene is enriched in the small intestine and is upregulated during differentiation of a human cell line that exhibits properties of intestinal epithelial cells. The encoded protein has been shown to modulate production of FGF19 in a human intestinal cell line and may regulate bile acid metabolism in the liver. A synergistic interaction between an allele of this gene and the APOE E4 allele is associated with an elevated risk of Alzheimer's disease in human patients.","Variant counts

Summary
The initiation of transcription is controlled in part by a large protein assembly known as the preinitiation complex. A component of this preinitiation complex is a 1.2 MDa protein aggregate called Mediator. This Mediator component binds with a CDK8 subcomplex which contains the protein encoded by this gene, mediator complex subunit 12 (MED12), along with MED13, CDK8 kinase, and cyclin C. The CDK8 subcomplex modulates Mediator-polymerase II interactions and thereby regulates transcription initiation and reinitation rates. The MED12 protein is essential for activating CDK8 kinase. Defects in this gene cause X-linked Opitz-Kaveggia syndrome, also known as FG syndrome, and Lujan-Fryns syndrome.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a component of the mediator complex (also known as TRAP, SMCC, DRIP, or ARC), a transcriptional coactivator complex thought to be required for the expression of almost all genes. The mediator complex is recruited by transcriptional activators or nuclear receptors to induce gene expression, possibly by interacting with RNA polymerase II and promoting the formation of a transcriptional pre-initiation complex. The product of this gene is proposed to form a sub-complex with MED12, cyclin C, and CDK8 that can negatively regulate transactivation by mediator.","Variant counts

Summary
The activation of gene transcription is a multistep process that is triggered by factors that recognize transcriptional enhancer sites in DNA. These factors work with co-activators to direct transcriptional initiation by the RNA polymerase II apparatus. The protein encoded by this gene is a subunit of the CRSP (cofactor required for SP1 activation) complex, which, along with TFIID, is required for efficient activation by SP1. This protein is also a component of other multisubunit complexes e.g. thyroid hormone receptor-(TR-) associated proteins which interact with TR and facilitate TR function on DNA templates in conjunction with initiation factors and cofactors. This protein contains a bipartite nuclear localization signal. This gene is known to escape chromosome X-inactivation.","Variant counts

Efficient translation of mitochondrial-derived transcripts requires proper assembly of the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. Central to the biogenesis of this large subunit is the A-loop of mitochondrial 16S rRNA, which is modified by three rRNA methyltransferases located near mtDNA nucleoids. The protein encoded by this gene methylates G(1370) of 16S rRNA, and this modification is necessary for proper ribosomal large subnit assembly. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The product of this gene is a member of the MADS/MEF2 family of DNA binding proteins. The protein is thought to regulate gene expression, including expression of the smooth muscle myosin heavy chain gene. This region undergoes considerable alternative splicing, with transcripts supporting two non-overlapping loci (GeneID 729991 and 100271849) as well as numerous read-through transcripts that span both loci (annotated as GeneID 4207). Several isoforms of this protein are expressed from either this locus or from some of the read-through transcripts annotated on GeneID 4207.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) family of transcription factors. Members of this family are involved in control of muscle and neuronal cell differentiation and development, and are regulated by class II histone deacetylases. Fusions of the encoded protein with Deleted in Azoospermia-Associated Protein 1 (DAZAP1) due to a translocation have been found in an acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, suggesting a role in leukemogenesis. The encoded protein may also be involved in Parkinson disease and myotonic dystrophy. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is one of the highly conserved mini-chromosome maintenance proteins (MCM) that are essential for the initiation of eukaryotic genome replication. The hexameric protein complex formed by the MCM proteins is a key component of the pre-replication complex (pre_RC) and may be involved in the formation of replication forks and in the recruitment of other DNA replication related proteins. The MCM complex consisting of this protein and MCM2, 4 and 6 proteins possesses DNA helicase activity, and may act as a DNA unwinding enzyme. Cyclin D1-dependent kinase, CDK4, is found to associate with this protein, and may regulate the binding of this protein with the tumorsuppressor protein RB1/RB. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been reported.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is one of the highly conserved mini-chromosome maintenance proteins (MCM) that are essential for the initiation of eukaryotic genome replication. The hexameric protein complex formed by the MCM proteins is a key component of the pre-replication complex (pre_RC) and may be involved in the formation of replication forks and in the recruitment of other DNA replication related proteins. The MCM complex consisting of this protein and MCM2, 4 and 7 proteins possesses DNA helicase activity, and may act as a DNA unwinding enzyme. The phosphorylation of the complex by CDC2 kinase reduces the helicase activity, suggesting a role in the regulation of DNA replication. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the intron regions of this gene are associated with differential transcriptional activation of the promoter of the neighboring lactase gene and, thereby, influence lactose intolerance in early adulthood.","Variant counts
The variants found in rare patients tested by 3billion are classified and counted according to ACMG guidelines. The variants with over 5% variant frequency in population genome databases ( gnomAD, dbSNP, etc) are excluded.

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is structurally very similar to the CDC46 protein from S. cerevisiae, a protein involved in the initiation of DNA replication. The encoded protein is a member of the MCM family of chromatin-binding proteins and can interact with at least two other members of this family. The encoded protein is upregulated in the transition from the G0 to G1/S phase of the cell cycle and may actively participate in cell cycle regulation.","Variant counts

The phosphorylation of this protein by CDC2 kinase reduces the DNA helicase activity and chromatin binding of the MCM complex. This gene is mapped to a region on the chromosome 8 head-to-head next to the PRKDC/DNA-PK, a DNA-activated protein kinase involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein have been reported.","Variant counts

Summary
Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are encoded by nuclear genes and help in protein synthesis within the mitochondrion. Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) consist of a small 28S subunit and a large 39S subunit. They have an estimated 75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes, where this ratio is reversed. Another difference between mammalian mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain a 5S rRNA. Among different species, the proteins comprising the mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence homology. This gene encodes a 39S subunit protein.","Variant counts

Summary
MYBPC3 encodes the cardiac isoform of myosin-binding protein C. Myosin-binding protein C is a myosin-associated protein found in the cross-bridge-bearing zone (C region) of A bands in striated muscle. MYBPC3, the cardiac isoform, is expressed exclussively in heart muscle. Regulatory phosphorylation of the cardiac isoform in vivo by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) upon adrenergic stimulation may be linked to modulation of cardiac contraction. Mutations in MYBPC3 are one cause of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the NAD/NADH-dependent, reversible oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate in many metabolic pathways, including the citric acid cycle. Two main isozymes are known to exist in eukaryotic cells: one is found in the mitochondrial matrix and the other in the cytoplasm. This gene encodes the cytosolic isozyme, which plays a key role in the malate-aspartate shuttle that allows malate to pass through the mitochondrial membrane to be transformed into oxaloacetate for further cellular processes. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. A recent study showed that a C-terminally extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform is localized in the peroxisomes. Pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes X and 6.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the mucin protein family. Mucins are high molecular weight glycoproteins produced by many epithelial tissues. The protein encoded by this gene is secreted and forms an insoluble mucous barrier that protects the gut lumen. The protein polymerizes into a gel of which 80% is composed of oligosaccharide side chains by weight. The protein features a central domain containing tandem repeats rich in threonine and proline that varies between 50 and 115 copies in different individuals. Downregulation of this gene has been observed in patients with Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a membrane-bound protein that is a member of the mucin family. Mucins are O-glycosylated proteins that play an essential role in forming protective mucous barriers on epithelial surfaces. These proteins also play a role in intracellular signaling. This protein is expressed on the apical surface of epithelial cells that line the mucosal surfaces of many different tissues including lung, breast stomach and pancreas. This protein is proteolytically cleaved into alpha and beta subunits that form a heterodimeric complex. The N-terminal alpha subunit functions in cell-adhesion and the C-terminal beta subunit is involved in cell signaling. Overexpression, aberrant intracellular localization, and changes in glycosylation of this protein have been associated with carcinomas. This gene is known to contain a highly polymorphic variable number tandem repeats (VNTR) domain. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

The Myc/Max/Mad network comprises a group of transcription factors that co-interact to regulate gene-specific transcriptional activation or repression. This gene encodes a protein member of the Myc/Max/Mad network. This protein has a basic-Helix-Loop-Helix-zipper domain (bHLHzip) with which it binds the canonical DNA sequence CANNTG, known as the E box, following heterodimerization with Max proteins. This protein is likely a transcriptional repressor and an antagonist of Myc-dependent transcriptional activation and cell growth. This protein represses transcription by binding to DNA binding proteins at its N-terminal Sin3-interaction domain.","Variant counts

Summary
Eukaryotic molybdoenzymes use a unique molybdenum cofactor (MoCo) consisting of a pterin, termed molybdopterin, and the catalytically active metal molybdenum. MoCo is synthesized from precursor Z by the heterodimeric enzyme molybdopterin synthase. The large and small subunits of molybdopterin synthase are both encoded from this gene by overlapping open reading frames. The proteins were initially thought to be encoded from a bicistronic transcript. They are now thought to be encoded from monocistronic transcripts. Alternatively spliced transcripts have been found for this locus that encode the large and small subunits.","Variant counts

Summary
Molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis is a conserved pathway leading to the biological activation of molybdenum. The protein encoded by this gene is involved in this pathway. This gene was originally thought to produce a bicistronic mRNA with the potential to produce two proteins (MOCS1A and MOCS1B) from adjacent open reading frames. However, only the first open reading frame (MOCS1A) has been found to encode a protein from the putative bicistronic mRNA, whereas additional splice variants are likely to produce a fusion between the two open reading frames. This gene is defective in patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency, type A. A related pseudogene has been identified on chromosome 16.","Variant counts

Summary
Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) is a signaling molecule that interacts with one of two receptors on cells targeted for apoptosis. The apoptotic signal is transduced inside these cells by cytoplasmic adaptor proteins. The protein encoded by this gene is a death domain-containing adaptor protein that interacts with the death domain of TNF-alpha receptor 1 to activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and propagate the apoptotic signal. It is membrane-bound and expressed at a higher level in neoplastic cells than in normal cells. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are encoded by nuclear genes and help in protein synthesis within the mitochondrion. Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) consist of a small 28S subunit and a large 39S subunit. They have an estimated 75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes, where this ratio is reversed. Another difference between mammalian mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain a 5S rRNA. Among different species, the proteins comprising the mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence homology. This gene encodes a 39S subunit protein. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Pseudogenes corresponding to this gene are found on chromosomes 2p and 17q.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes s receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum, which plays a role in the export of large pre-chylomicrons and pre-very low density lipoproteins (pre-VLDLs). Three major classes of transcripts are generated from this gene- melanoma inhibitory activity 2-specific transcripts, cTAGE family member 5-specific transcripts and transcripts that include exons from both these transcript species (TANGO1-like or TALI). Additionally, alternative splicing in these transcripts results in multiple transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the myosin superfamily. Myosins are actin-dependent motor proteins and are categorized into conventional myosins (class II) and unconventional myosins (classes I and III through XV) based on their variable C-terminal cargo-binding domains. Class III myosins, such as this one, have a kinase domain N-terminal to the conserved N-terminal motor domains and are expressed in photoreceptors. The protein encoded by this gene plays an important role in hearing in humans. Three different recessive, loss of function mutations in the encoded protein have been shown to cause nonsyndromic progressive hearing loss. Expression of this gene is highly restricted, with the strongest expression in retina and cochlea.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene was first identified by its binding to the APC protein which is often mutated in familial and sporadic forms of colorectal cancer. This protein localizes to microtubules, especially the growing ends, in interphase cells. During mitosis, the protein is associated with the centrosomes and spindle microtubules. The protein also associates with components of the dynactin complex and the intermediate chain of cytoplasmic dynein. Because of these associations, it is thought that this protein is involved in the regulation of microtubule structures and chromosome stability. This gene is a member of the RP/EB family.","Variant counts

Summary
The activation of gene transcription is a multistep process that is triggered by factors that recognize transcriptional enhancer sites in DNA. These factors work with co-activators to direct transcriptional initiation by the RNA polymerase II apparatus. The protein encoded by this gene is a subunit of the CRSP (cofactor required for SP1 activation) complex, which, along with TFIID, is required for efficient activation by SP1. This protein is also a component of other multisubunit complexes e.g. thyroid hormone receptor-(TR-) associated proteins which interact with TR and facilitate TR function on DNA templates in conjunction with initiation factors and cofactors. This protein also acts as a metastasis suppressor. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a DNA glycosylase involved in oxidative DNA damage repair. The enzyme excises adenine bases from the DNA backbone at sites where adenine is inappropriately paired with guanine, cytosine, or 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine, a major oxidatively damaged DNA lesion. The protein is localized to the nucleus and mitochondria. This gene product is thought to play a role in signaling apoptosis by the introduction of single-strand breaks following oxidative damage. Mutations in this gene result in heritable predisposition to colorectal cancer, termed MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP). Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the myosin gene family. Myosins are mechanochemical proteins characterized by the presence of a motor domain, an actin-binding domain, a neck domain that interacts with other proteins, and a tail domain that serves as an anchor. This gene encodes an unconventional myosin with a very short tail. Defects in this gene are associated with the mouse shaker-1 phenotype and the human Usher syndrome 1B which are characterized by deafness, reduced vestibular function, and (in human) retinal degeneration. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes the major component of the vault complex. Vaults are multi-subunit ribonucleoprotein structures that may be involved in nucleo-cytoplasmic transport. The encoded protein may play a role in multiple cellular processes by regulating the MAP kinase, JAK/STAT and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathways. The encoded protein also plays a role in multidrug resistance, and expression of this gene may be a prognostic marker for several types of cancer.

Summary
This gene encodes the peroxisomal enzyme mevalonate kinase. Mevalonate is a key intermediate, and mevalonate kinase a key early enzyme, in isoprenoid and sterol synthesis. Mevalonate kinase deficiency caused by mutation of this gene results in mevalonic aciduria, a disease characterized psychomotor retardation, failure to thrive, hepatosplenomegaly, anemia and recurrent febrile crises. Defects in this gene also cause hyperimmunoglobulinaemia D and periodic fever syndrome, a disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of fever associated with lymphadenopathy, arthralgia, gastrointestinal dismay and skin rash. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The gene variously symbolized ALL1, HRX, or MLL located on 11q23 has been demonstrated to be fused with a number of translocation partners in cases of leukemia. t(1;11)(q21;q23) translocations that fused the MLL gene to a gene on chromosomal band 1q21 in 2 infants with acute myelomonocytic leukemia have been demonstrated. The N-terminal portion of the MLL gene is critical for leukemogenesis in translocations involving band 11q23. This gene encodes 90 amino acids. It was found to be highly expressed in the thymus but not in peripheral lymphoid tissues. In contrast to its restricted distribution in normal hematopoietic tissue, this gene was expressed in all leukemic cell lines tested.","Variant counts

Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are encoded by nuclear genes and help in protein synthesis within the mitochondrion. Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) consist of a small 28S subunit and a large 39S subunit. They have an estimated 75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes, where this ratio is reversed. Another difference between mammalian mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain a 5S rRNA. Among different species, the proteins comprising the mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence homology. This gene encodes a 28S subunit protein that may be a functional partner of the death associated protein 3 (DAP3). Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is one of the highly conserved mini-chromosome maintenance proteins (MCM) that are involved in the initiation of eukaryotic genome replication. The hexameric protein complex formed by MCM proteins is a key component of the pre-replication complex (pre-RC) and it may be involved in the formation of replication forks and in the recruitment of other DNA replication related proteins. This protein can interact with MCM2 and MCM6, as well as with the origin recognition protein ORC2. It is regulated by proteolysis and phosphorylation in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Studies of a similar protein in Xenopus suggest that the chromatin binding of this protein at the onset of DNA replication is after pre-RC assembly and before origin unwinding. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been identified.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the zinc finger superfamily of transcription factors whose expression, thus far, has been found only in neuronal tissues. The encoded protein belongs to a novel class of cystein-cystein-histidine-cystein zinc finger proteins that function in the developing mammalian central nervous system. Forced expression of this gene in combination with the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor NeuroD1 and the transcription factors POU class 3 homeobox 2 and achaete-scute family basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor 1 can convert fetal and postnatal human fibroblasts into induced neuronal cells, which are able to generate action potentials. Mutations in this gene have been associated with an autosomal dominant form of cognitive disability and with autism spectrum disorder. Alternative splicing results in multiple variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the muscleblind protein family which was initially described in Drosophila melanogaster. The encoded protein is a C3H-type zinc finger protein that modulates alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs. Muscleblind proteins bind specifically to expanded dsCUG RNA but not to normal size CUG repeats and may thereby play a role in the pathophysiology of myotonic dystrophy. Mice lacking this gene exhibited muscle abnormalities and cataracts. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described but the full-length natures of only some have been determined. The different isoforms are thought to have different binding specificities and/or splicing activities.","Variant counts
The variants found in rare patients tested by 3billion are classified and counted according to ACMG guidelines. The variants with over 5% variant frequency in population genome databases ( gnomAD, dbSNP, etc) are excluded.

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene binds to the N-terminus of the oncogenic protein C-MYC, enhancing the ability of C-MYC to activate E box-dependent transcription. The encoded protein is normally found in the cytoplasm, but it translocates to the nucleus during S phase of the cell cycle and associates with C-MYC. This protein may be involved in spermatogenesis. This gene can be silenced by microRNA-22. Two transcript variants, one protein-coding and the other probably not protein-coding, have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene plays a role in mitochondrial translation termination, and is thought to be a release factor that is involved in the dissociation of the complete protein from the final tRNA, the ribosome, and the cognate mRNA. This protein acts upon UAA and UAG stop codons, but has no in vitro activity against UGA, which encodes tryptophan in human mitochondrion, or, the mitochondrial non-cognate stop codons, AGA and AGG. This protein shares sequence similarity to bacterial release factors. Pseudogenes of this gene are found on chromosomes 4, 8, and 11. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
DNA methylation is the major modification of eukaryotic genomes and plays an essential role in mammalian development. Human proteins MECP2, MBD1, MBD2, MBD3, and MBD4 comprise a family of nuclear proteins related by the presence in each of a methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD). Each of these proteins, with the exception of MBD3, is capable of binding specifically to methylated DNA. MECP2, MBD1 and MBD2 can also repress transcription from methylated gene promoters. In contrast to other MBD family members, MECP2 is X-linked and subject to X inactivation. MECP2 is dispensible in stem cells, but is essential for embryonic development. MECP2 gene mutations are the cause of most cases of Rett syndrome, a progressive neurologic developmental disorder and one of the most common causes of cognitive disability in females. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
Meprins are multidomain zinc metalloproteases that are highly expressed in mammalian kidney and intestinal brush border membranes, and in leukocytes and certain cancer cells. They are involved in the hydrolysis of a variety of peptide and protein substrates, and have been implicated in cancer and intestinal inflammation. Mature meprins are oligomers of evolutionarily related, but separately encoded alpha and/or beta subunits. Homooligomers of alpha subunit are secreted, whereas, oligomers containing the beta subunit are plasma membrane-bound. This gene encodes the beta subunit. Targeted disruption of this gene in mice affects embryonic viability, renal gene expression profiles, and distribution of the membrane-associated alpha subunit in kidney and intestine.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell surface glycoprotein that is expressed predominantly in the developing nervous system. In addition to possessing several cell adhesion molecule-like domains, the mature protein has six Ig-like domains, a single fibronectin type III domain, a MAM domain and a C-terminal GPI-anchoring site. Studies in other mammals suggest this protein plays a role in cell adhesion, migration, and axon guidance and, in the developing brain, neuronal migration. In humans, this gene is associated with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.","Variant counts

This gene encodes a protein that possesses three distinct enzymatic activities, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase, 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase and 10-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase. Each of these activities catalyzes one of three sequential reactions in the interconversion of 1-carbon derivatives of tetrahydrofolate, which are substrates for methionine, thymidylate, and de novo purine syntheses. The trifunctional enzymatic activities are conferred by two major domains, an aminoterminal portion containing the dehydrogenase and cyclohydrolase activities and a larger synthetase domain.","Variant counts

This gene product is an integral membrane protein that is a G-protein coupled, 7-transmembrane receptor. It is found primarily in the retina and brain although this detection requires RT-PCR. It is thought to participate in light-dependent functions in the retina and may be involved in the neurobiological effects of melatonin.","Variant counts

This gene encodes one of two high affinity forms of a receptor for melatonin, the primary hormone secreted by the pineal gland. This receptor is a G-protein coupled, 7-transmembrane receptor that is responsible for melatonin effects on mammalian circadian rhythm and reproductive alterations affected by day length. The receptor is an integral membrane protein that is readily detectable and localized to two specific regions of the brain. The hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus appears to be involved in circadian rhythm while the hypophysial pars tuberalis may be responsible for the reproductive effects of melatonin.","Variant counts

Summary
MAP1A and MAP1B are microtubule-associated proteins which mediate the physical interactions between microtubules and components of the cytoskeleton. MAP1A and MAP1B each consist of a heavy chain subunit and multiple light chain subunits. The protein encoded by this gene is one of the light chain subunits and can associate with either MAP1A or MAP1B. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. The expression of variant 1 is suppressed in many tumor cell lines, suggesting that may be involved in carcinogenesis.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) family. The MBD consists of about 70 residues and is the minimal region required for a methyl-CpG-binding protein binding specifically to methylated DNA. In addition to the MBD domain, this protein contains a PWWP domain (Pro-Trp-Trp-Pro motif), which consists of 100-150 amino acids and is found in numerous proteins that are involved in cell division, growth and differentiation. Mutations in this gene cause an autosomal dominant type of cognitive disability. The encoded protein interacts with the polycomb repressive complex PR-DUB which catalyzes the deubiquitination of a lysine residue of histone 2A. Haploinsufficiency of this gene is associated with a syndrome involving microcephaly, intellectual disabilities, severe speech impairment, and seizures. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found, but their full-length nature is not determined.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of a family of nuclear proteins related by the presence of a methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD). These proteins are capable of binding specifically to methylated DNA, and some members can also repress transcription from methylated gene promoters. This protein contains an MBD domain at the N-terminus that functions both in binding to methylated DNA and in protein interactions and a C-terminal mismatch-specific glycosylase domain that is involved in DNA repair. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of a family of nuclear proteins related by the presence of a methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD). These proteins are capable of binding specifically to methylated DNA, and some members can also repress transcription from methylated gene promoters. This protein contains multiple domains: MBD at the N-terminus that functions both in binding to methylated DNA and in protein interactions; several CXXC-type zinc finger domains that mediate binding to non-methylated CpG dinucleotides; transcriptional repression domain (TRD) at the C-terminus that is involved in transcription repression and in protein interactions. Numerous alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been noted for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
DNA methylation is the major modification of eukaryotic genomes and plays an essential role in mammalian development. This gene belongs to a family of nuclear proteins which are characterized by the presence of a methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD). The encoded protein is a subunit of the NuRD, a multisubunit complex containing nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase activities. Unlike the other family members, the encoded protein is not capable of binding to methylated DNA. The protein mediates the association of metastasis-associated protein 2 with the core histone deacetylase complex. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants of this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
DNA methylation is the major modification of eukaryotic genomes and plays an essential role in mammalian development. Human proteins MECP2, MBD1, MBD2, MBD3, and MBD4 comprise a family of nuclear proteins related by the presence in each of a methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD). Each of these proteins, with the exception of MBD3, is capable of binding specifically to methylated DNA. MECP2, MBD1 and MBD2 can also repress transcription from methylated gene promoters. The protein encoded by this gene may function as a mediator of the biological consequences of the methylation signal. It is also reported that the this protein functions as a demethylase to activate transcription, as DNA methylation causes gene silencing. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the exophilin subfamily of Rab effector proteins. The protein forms a ternary complex with the small Ras-related GTPase Rab27A in its GTP-bound form and the motor protein myosin Va. A similar protein complex in mouse functions to tether pigment-producing organelles called melanosomes to the actin cytoskeleton in melanocytes, and is required for visible pigmentation in the hair and skin. A mutation in this gene results in Griscelli syndrome type 3, which is characterized by a silver-gray hair color and abnormal pigment distribution in the hair shaft. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLHZ) family of transcription factors. It is able to form homodimers and heterodimers with other family members, which include Mad, Mxi1 and Myc. Myc is an oncoprotein implicated in cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The homodimers and heterodimers compete for a common DNA target site (the E box) and rearrangement among these dimer forms provides a complex system of transcriptional regulation. Mutations of this gene have been reported to be associated with hereditary pheochromocytoma. A pseudogene of this gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 7. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a highly hydrophobic integral membrane protein belonging to the MAL family of proteolipids. The protein has been localized to the endoplasmic reticulum of T-cells and is a candidate linker protein in T-cell signal transduction. In addition, this proteolipid is localized in compact myelin of cells in the nervous system and has been implicated in myelin biogenesis and/or function. The protein plays a role in the formation, stabilization and maintenance of glycosphingolipid-enriched membrane microdomains. Down-regulation of this gene has been associated with a variety of human epithelial malignancies. Alternative splicing produces four transcript variants which vary from each other by the presence or absence of alternatively spliced exons 2 and 3.","Variant counts

Summary
Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are encoded by nuclear genes and help in protein synthesis within the mitochondrion. Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) consist of a small 28S subunit and a large 39S subunit. They have an estimated 75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes, where this ratio is reversed. Another difference between mammalian mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain a 5S rRNA. Among different species, the proteins comprising the mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence homology. This gene encodes a 39S subunit protein. Sequence analysis identified alternatively spliced variants that encode different protein isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a myotubularin-related protein that is atypical to most other members of the myotubularin-related protein family because it has no dual-specificity phosphatase domain. The encoded protein contains a double-helical motif similar to the SET interaction domain, which is thought to have a role in the control of cell proliferation. In mouse, a protein similar to the encoded protein binds with MTMR7, and together they dephosphorylate phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and inositol 1,3-bisphosphate.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the myotubularin family of tyrosine/dual-specificity phosphatases. The encoded protein is characterized by four distinct domains that are conserved among all members of the myotubularin family: the glucosyltransferase, Rab-like GTPase activator and myotubularins domain, the Rac-induced recruitment domain, the protein tyrosine phosphatases and dual-specificity phosphatases domain and the suppressor of variegation 3-9, enhancer-of-zeste, and trithorax interaction domain. This protein dephosphorylates the target substrates phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and inositol 1,3-bisphosphate. A pseudogene of this gene is found on chromosome 5.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the myotubularin dual specificity protein phosphatase gene family. The encoded protein is structurally similar to myotubularin but in addition contains a FYVE domain and an N-terminal PH-GRAM domain. The protein can self-associate and also form heteromers with another myotubularin related protein. The protein binds to phosphoinositide lipids through the PH-GRAM domain, and can hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol(3)-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol(3,5)-biphosphate in vitro. The encoded protein has been observed to have a perinuclear, possibly membrane-bound, distribution in cells, but it has also been found free in the cytoplasm. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the myosin superfamily. The protein represents a conventional non-muscle myosin; it should not be confused with the unconventional myosin-10 (MYO10). Myosins are actin-dependent motor proteins with diverse functions including regulation of cytokinesis, cell motility, and cell polarity.

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a smooth muscle myosin belonging to the myosin heavy chain family. The gene product is a subunit of a hexameric protein that consists of two heavy chain subunits and two pairs of non-identical light chain subunits. It functions as a major contractile protein, converting chemical energy into mechanical energy through the hydrolysis of ATP. The gene encoding a human ortholog of rat NUDE1 is transcribed from the reverse strand of this gene, and its 3' end overlaps with that of the latter. The pericentric inversion of chromosome 16 [inv(16)(p13q22)] produces a chimeric transcript that encodes a protein consisting of the first 165 residues from the N terminus of core-binding factor beta in a fusion with the C-terminal portion of the smooth muscle myosin heavy chain. This chromosomal rearrangement is associated with acute myeloid leukemia of the M4Eo subtype. Alternative splicing generates isoforms that are differentially expressed, with ratios changing during muscle cell maturation. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified.","Variant counts

Summary
This intronless gene encodes the receptor protein for melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH). The encoded protein, a seven pass transmembrane G protein coupled receptor, controls melanogenesis. Two types of melanin exist: red pheomelanin and black eumelanin. Gene mutations that lead to a loss in function are associated with increased pheomelanin production, which leads to lighter skin and hair color. Eumelanin is photoprotective but pheomelanin may contribute to UV-induced skin damage by generating free radicals upon UV radiation. Binding of MSH to its receptor activates the receptor and stimulates eumelanin synthesis. This receptor is a major determining factor in sun sensitivity and is a genetic risk factor for melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer. Over 30 variant alleles have been identified which correlate with skin and hair color, providing evidence that this gene is an important component in determining normal human pigment variation.","Variant counts

Mutations in dysferlin, a protein associated with the plasma membrane, can cause muscle weakness that affects both proximal and distal muscles. The protein encoded by this gene is a type II membrane protein that is structurally similar to dysferlin. It is a member of the ferlin family and associates with both plasma and nuclear membranes. The protein contains C2 domains that play a role in calcium-mediated membrane fusion events, suggesting that it may be involved in membrane regeneration and repair. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. Other possible variants have been detected, but their full-length nature has not been determined.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a reverse-direction motor protein that moves toward the minus end of actin filaments and plays a role in intracellular vesicle and organelle transport. The protein consists of a motor domain containing an ATP- and an actin-binding site and a globular tail which interacts with other proteins. This protein maintains the structural integrity of inner ear hair cells and mutations in this gene cause non-syndromic autosomal dominant and recessive hearing loss. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are encoded by nuclear genes and help in protein synthesis within the mitochondrion. Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) consist of a small 28S subunit and a large 39S subunit. They have an estimated 75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes, where this ratio is reversed. Another difference between mammalian mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain a 5S rRNA. Among different species, the proteins comprising the mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence homology. This gene encodes a 39S subunit protein. A pseudogene corresponding to this gene is found on chromosome 2p.","Variant counts

Summary
The N-terminal methionine excision pathway is an essential process in which the N-terminal methionine is removed from many proteins, thus facilitating subsequent protein modification. In mitochondria, enzymes that catalyze this reaction are celled methionine aminopeptidases (MetAps, or MAPs; EC 3.4.11.18) (Serero et al., 2003 [PubMed 14532271]).","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene forms a heterodimer with MSH2 to form MutS beta, part of the post-replicative DNA mismatch repair system. MutS beta initiates mismatch repair by binding to a mismatch and then forming a complex with MutL alpha heterodimer. This gene contains a polymorphic 9 bp tandem repeat sequence in the first exon. The repeat is present 6 times in the reference genome sequence and 3-7 repeats have been reported. Defects in this gene are a cause of susceptibility to endometrial cancer.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the mutS family of proteins that are involved in DNA mismatch repair and meiotic recombination. This protein is similar to a Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein that participates in segregation fidelity and crossing-over events during meiosis. This protein plays a role in promoting ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis. This protein forms hetero-oligomers with another member of this family, mutS homolog 4. Polymorphisms in this gene have been linked to various human diseases, including IgA deficiency, common variable immunodeficiency, and premature ovarian failure. Alternative splicing results multiple transcript variants. Read-through transcription also exists between this gene and the downstream chromosome 6 open reading frame 26 (C6orf26) gene.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the DNA mismatch repair MutS family. In E. coli, the MutS protein helps in the recognition of mismatched nucleotides prior to their repair. A highly conserved region of approximately 150 aa, called the Walker-A adenine nucleotide binding motif, exists in MutS homologs. The encoded protein heterodimerizes with MSH2 to form a mismatch recognition complex that functions as a bidirectional molecular switch that exchanges ADP and ATP as DNA mismatches are bound and dissociated. Mutations in this gene may be associated with hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer, colorectal cancer, and endometrial cancer. Transcripts variants encoding different isoforms have been described.","Variant counts

This gene encodes an enzyme that sulfurates the molybdenum cofactor which is required for activation of the xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) and aldehyde oxidase (AO) enzymes. XDH catalyzes the conversion of hypoxanthine to uric acid via xanthine, as well as the conversion of allopurinol to oxypurinol, and pyrazinamide to 5-hydroxy pyrazinamide. Mutations in this gene cause the metabolic disorder classical xanthinuria type II which is characterized by the loss of XDH/XO and AO enzyme activity, decreased levels of uric acid in the urine, increased levels of xanthine and hypoxanthine in the serum and urine, formation of xanthine stones in the urinary tract, and myositis due to tissue deposition of xanthine.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is one of the highly conserved mini-chromosome maintenance proteins (MCM) that are involved in the initiation of eukaryotic genome replication. The hexameric protein complex formed by MCM proteins is a key component of the pre-replication complex (pre_RC) and may be involved in the formation of replication forks and in the recruitment of other DNA replication related proteins. This protein is a subunit of the protein complex that consists of MCM2-7. It has been shown to interact directly with MCM5/CDC46. This protein also interacts with and is acetylated by MCM3AP, a chromatin-associated acetyltransferase. The acetylation of this protein inhibits the initiation of DNA replication and cell cycle progression. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
The allergic response involves the binding of allergen to receptor-bound IgE followed by cell activation and the release of mediators responsible for the manifestations of allergy. The IgE-receptor, a tetramer composed of an alpha, beta, and 2 disulfide-linked gamma chains, is found on the surface of mast cells and basophils. This gene encodes the beta subunit of the high affinity IgE receptor which is a member of the membrane-spanning 4A gene family. Members of this nascent protein family are characterized by common structural features and similar intron/exon splice boundaries and display unique expression patterns among hematopoietic cells and nonlymphoid tissues. This family member is localized to 11q12, among a cluster of membrane-spanning 4A gene family members. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct proteins. Additional transcript variants have been described but require experimental validation.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene is a component of the ESCRT-I complex, a heterotetramer, which mediates the sorting of ubiquitinated cargo protein from the plasma membrane to the endosomal vesicle. ESCRT-I complex plays an essential role in HIV budding and endosomal protein sorting. Depletion and overexpression of this and related protein (MVB12A) inhibit HIV-1 infectivity and induce unusual viral assembly defects, indicating a role for MVB12 subunits in regulating ESCRT-mediated virus budding. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

The recognition of complex carbohydrate structures on glycoproteins is an important part of several biological processes, including cell-cell recognition, serum glycoprotein turnover, and neutralization of pathogens. The protein encoded by this gene is a type I membrane receptor that mediates the endocytosis of glycoproteins by macrophages. The protein has been shown to bind high-mannose structures on the surface of potentially pathogenic viruses, bacteria, and fungi so that they can be neutralized by phagocytic engulfment.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a proto-oncogene and encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein that plays a role in cell cycle progression, apoptosis and cellular transformation. The encoded protein forms a heterodimer with the related transcription factor MAX. This complex binds to the E box DNA consensus sequence and regulates the transcription of specific target genes. Amplification of this gene is frequently observed in numerous human cancers. Translocations involving this gene are associated with Burkitt lymphoma and multiple myeloma in human patients. There is evidence to show that translation initiates both from an upstream, in-frame non-AUG (CUG) and a downstream AUG start site, resulting in the production of two isoforms with distinct N-termini.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the methionyl aminopeptidase family. The encoded protein functions both by protecting the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 from inhibitory phosphorylation and by removing the amino-terminal methionine residue from nascent proteins. Increased expression of this gene is associated with various forms of cancer, and the anti-cancer drugs fumagillin and ovalicin inhibit the protein by irreversibly binding to its active site. Inhibitors of this gene have also been shown to be effective for the treatment of obesity. A pseudogene of this gene is located on chromosome 2. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.","Variant counts

Summary
Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are encoded by nuclear genes and help in protein synthesis within the mitochondrion. Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) consist of a small 28S subunit and a large 39S subunit. They have an estimated 75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes, where this ratio is reversed. Another difference between mammalian mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain a 5S rRNA. Among different species, the proteins comprising the mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence homology. This gene encodes a 28S subunit protein that has had confusing nomenclature in the literature. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. Pseudogenes corresponding to this gene are found on chromosomes 3p, 5q, and 10q.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a soluble luminal protein with two calmodulin-like EF-hand motifs at its C-terminus. This protein forms a complex with LMAN1 (lectin mannose binding protein 1; also known as ERGIC-53) that facilitates the transport of coagulation factors V (FV) and VIII (FVIII) from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus via an endoplasmic reticulum Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). Mutations in this gene cause combined deficiency of FV and FVIII (F5F8D); a rare autosomal recessive bleeding disorder characterized by mild to moderate bleeding and coordinate reduction in plasma FV and FVIII levels. This protein has also been shown to maintain stem cell potential in adult central nervous system and is a marker for testicular germ cell tumors. The 3' UTR of this gene contains a transposon-like human repeat element named 'THE 1'. A processed RNA pseudogene of this gene is on chromosome 6p22.1. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the MAP kinase family. MAP kinases act as an integration point for multiple biochemical signals, and are involved in a wide variety of cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, transcription regulation and development. This kinase targets specific transcription factors, and thus mediates immediate-early gene expression in response to various cell stimuli. It is most closely related to MAPK8, both of which are involved in UV radiation induced apoptosis, thought to be related to the cytochrome c-mediated cell death pathway. This gene and MAPK8 are also known as c-Jun N-terminal kinases. This kinase blocks the ubiquitination of tumor suppressor p53, and thus it increases the stability of p53 in nonstressed cells. Studies of this gene's mouse counterpart suggest a key role in T-cell differentiation. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been reported.","Variant counts

Summary
The activation of gene transcription is a multistep process that is triggered by factors that recognize transcriptional enhancer sites in DNA. These factors work with co-activators to direct transcriptional initiation by the RNA polymerase II apparatus. The protein encoded by this gene is a subunit of the CRSP (cofactor required for SP1 activation) complex, which, along with TFIID, is required for efficient activation by SP1. This protein is also a component of other multisubunit complexes e.g. thyroid hormone receptor-(TR-) associated proteins which interact with TR and facilitate TR function on DNA templates in conjunction with initiation factors and cofactors.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a serine protease that functions as a component of the lectin pathway of complement activation. The complement pathway plays an essential role in the innate and adaptive immune response. The encoded protein is synthesized as a zymogen and is activated when it complexes with the pathogen recognition molecules of lectin pathway, the mannose-binding lectin and the ficolins. This protein is not directly involved in complement activation but may play a role as an amplifier of complement activation by cleaving complement C2 or by activating another complement serine protease, MASP-2. The encoded protein is also able to cleave fibrinogen and factor XIII and may may be involved in coagulation. A splice variant of this gene which lacks the serine protease domain functions as an inhibitor of the complement pathway. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a member of the peptidase S1 family of serine proteases. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate A and B chains that heterodimerize to form the mature protease. This protease cleaves complement components C2 and C4 in order to generate C3 convertase in the lectin pathway of the complement system. The encoded protease also plays a role in the coagulation cascade through cleavage of prothrombin to form thrombin. Myocardial infarction and acute stroke patients exhibit reduced serum concentrations of the encoded protein. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, at least one of which encodes an isoform that is proteolytically processed.","Variant counts

Summary
The minichromosome maintenance protein 3 (MCM3) is one of the MCM proteins essential for the initiation of DNA replication. The protein encoded by this gene is a MCM3 binding protein. It was reported to have phosphorylation-dependent DNA-primase activity, which was up-regulated in antigen immunization induced germinal center. This protein was demonstrated to be an acetyltransferase that acetylates MCM3 and plays a role in DNA replication. The mutagenesis of a nuclear localization signal of MCM3 affects the binding of this protein with MCM3, suggesting that this protein may also facilitate MCM3 nuclear localization. This gene is expressed in the brain or in neuronal tissue. An allelic variant encoding amino acid Lys at 915, instead of conserved Glu, has been identified in patients with mild intellectual disability.","Variant counts

Summary
Myosin is a major contractile protein which converts chemical energy into mechanical energy through the hydrolysis of ATP. Myosin is a hexameric protein composed of a pair of myosin heavy chains (MYH) and two pairs of nonidentical light chains. Myosin heavy chains are encoded by a multigene family. In mammals at least 10 different myosin heavy chain (MYH) isoforms have been described from striated, smooth, and nonmuscle cells. These isoforms show expression that is spatially and temporally regulated during development.","Variant counts

Summary
Muscle myosin is a hexameric protein containing 2 heavy chain subunits, 2 alkali light chain subunits, and 2 regulatory light chain subunits. This gene encodes the beta (or slow) heavy chain subunit of cardiac myosin. It is expressed predominantly in normal human ventricle. It is also expressed in skeletal muscle tissues rich in slow-twitch type I muscle fibers. Changes in the relative abundance of this protein and the alpha (or fast) heavy subunit of cardiac myosin correlate with the contractile velocity of cardiac muscle. Its expression is also altered during thyroid hormone depletion and hemodynamic overloading. Mutations in this gene are associated with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, myosin storage myopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and Laing early-onset distal myopathy.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene encodes a conventional non-muscle myosin; this protein should not be confused with the unconventional myosin-9a or 9b (MYO9A or MYO9B). The encoded protein is a myosin IIA heavy chain that contains an IQ domain and a myosin head-like domain which is involved in several important functions, including cytokinesis, cell motility and maintenance of cell shape. Defects in this gene have been associated with non-syndromic sensorineural deafness autosomal dominant type 17, Epstein syndrome, Alport syndrome with macrothrombocytopenia, Sebastian syndrome, Fechtner syndrome and macrothrombocytopenia with progressive sensorineural deafness.","Variant counts

The protein encoded by this gene, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family 1, is an integral plasma membrane protein which binds melanin-concentrating hormone. The encoded protein can inhibit cAMP accumulation and stimulate intracellular calcium flux, and is probably involved in the neuronal regulation of food consumption. Although structurally similar to somatostatin receptors, this protein does not seem to bind somatostatin.","Variant counts

Summary
The protein encoded by this gene contains an N-terminal forkhead domain, two BRCA1 C-terminal (BRCT) motifs and a central domain with 13 repetitions of an approximately 41-amino acid sequence. The encoded protein is required to activate the intra-S phase and G2/M phase cell cycle checkpoints in response to DNA damage. This nuclear protein interacts with phosphorylated histone H2AX near sites of DNA double-strand breaks through its BRCT motifs, and facilitates recruitment of the ATM kinase and meiotic recombination 11 protein complex to DNA damage foci.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is one of three myosin V heavy-chain genes, belonging to the myosin gene superfamily. Myosin V is a class of actin-based motor proteins involved in cytoplasmic vesicle transport and anchorage, spindle-pole alignment and mRNA translocation. The protein encoded by this gene is abundant in melanocytes and nerve cells. Mutations in this gene cause Griscelli syndrome type-1 (GS1), Griscelli syndrome type-3 (GS3) and neuroectodermal melanolysosomal disease, or Elejalde disease. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been reported, but the full-length nature of some variants has not been determined.","Variant counts

Summary
This gene is a member of the metallothionein family of genes. Proteins encoded by this gene family are low in molecular weight, are cysteine-rich, lack aromatic residues, and bind divalent heavy metal ions. This gene family member displays tissue-specific expression, and contains a threonine insert near its N-terminus and a glutamate-rich hexapeptide insert near its C-terminus relative to the proteins encoded by other gene family members. It plays an important role in zinc and copper homeostasis, and is induced under hypoxic conditions. The encoded protein is a growth inhibitory factor, and reduced levels of the protein are observed in the brains of individuals with some metal-linked neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.","Variant counts
